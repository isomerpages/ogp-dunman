Character Development is the foundation of every Dunmanian’s education experience.  The school rules provide a moral compass for Dunmanians as they set out in their journey to

1.  Develop **Self-Awareness and Self-Management** skills for personal well-being, growth and maturity
2.  Develop **Social Awareness and Manage Relationships** for one’s social well-being,
3.  **Make Informed Choices and Responsible Decisions** so as to contribute positively to the community.

These aims are also guided by the Ministry of Education’s Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) outcomes, nurturing students to have,

*   Good Character
*   Resilience and Social Emotional Well-Being
*   Future Readiness
*   Active Citizenry

### **1. Attendance and Punctuality**
1.1 All students are to report to school punctually and make their way to the respective venues for Flag Raising Ceremony.
