<p><strong>Character Development is the foundation of every Dunmanian’s education. Our School Rules serve as a moral compass to help every Dunmanian</strong>:</p>

<p>Develop <strong>Self-Awareness and Self-Management</strong> for personal
growth and well-being.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cultivate <strong>Social Awareness and Relationship Management</strong> for
harmony and teamwork.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make <strong>Informed, Responsible Decisions</strong> that contribute to
the greater good.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>These aims are also guided by the Ministry of Education’s Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) outcomes, nurturing students to have,</strong>
</p>
