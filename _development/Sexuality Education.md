<h3><strong>MOE Sexuality Education in Schools</strong></h3>
<p>Sexuality Education (SEd) in schools is about enabling students to understand
the physiological, social and emotional changes they experience as they
mature, develop healthy and rewarding relationships including those with
members of the opposite sex, and make wise, informed and responsible decisions
on sexuality matters. SEd is premised on the importance of the family as
the basic unit of society. This means encouraging healthy, heterosexual
marriages and stable nuclear family units with extended family support.
The teaching and learning of SEd is based on respect for the values and
beliefs of the different ethnic and religious communities in Singapore
on sexuality issues.</p>
<p>The goals of Sexuality Education are to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>To help students make wise, responsible and informed decisions through
the provision of accurate, current and age-appropriate knowledge on human
sexuality and the consequences of sexual activity;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To help students know themselves and build healthy and rewarding relationships
through the acquisition of social and emotional skills of self-awareness,
management of their thoughts, feelings and behaviours, development of empathy
for others, possession of effective communication, problem-solving and
decision-making skills; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To help students develop a moral compass, respect for themselves and for
others as sexual beings, premised on the family as the basic unit of society,
through the inculcation of positive mainstream values and attitudes about
sexuality.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The key messages of Sexuality Education are:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Love and respect yourself as you love and respect others;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build positive relationships based on love and respect (which are the
foundation for strong families);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make responsible decisions for yourself, your family and society; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abstinence before marriage is the best protection against STIs/HIV and
unintended pregnancies. Casual sex can harm and hurt you and your loved
ones.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>Sexuality Education Lessons</strong></h4>
<p>The values and attitudes of our youth towards sexuality are increasingly
shaped by their peers, exposure to the media, popular culture and the internet.
Adolescence is a complex stage in life as the adolescent attempts to find
his/her own identity and often struggles with new social relationships.
The period of middle adolescence (generally from 15 – 17 years old) can
be a turbulent period for adolescents. The gap between physical and emotional/cognitive
maturity may result in a tendency to act on impulse, experiment with various
activities (including sexual activities), sometimes without understanding
the unpleasant consequences that may arise from such experimentation. The
need for peer acceptance can be overwhelmingly strong, and hinder one’s
ability to act responsibly. Given the pressures faced by the middle adolescent
from within themselves and from peers, it is important to build a strong
sense of self-worth, personal conviction and an understanding of the possible
consequences of sexual behaviour.</p>
<p>Through the Sexuality Education lessons, secondary students will have
the opportunity to develop a positive self-esteem, develop their character,
and expand their understanding and repertoire of skills to deal with various
issues related to sexuality, which are of prime concern at this age.</p>
<p><strong>At Dunman High School, the following lessons from the Sexuality Education Programme will be taught in 2024.</strong>

<p>The focus for Sexuality Education at Pre-University is on respectful relationships.

themes of Human Development, Sexual Health, Sexual Behaviour, and Culture,
Society and Law woven into the main focus on relationships.</p>
<h4><strong>Secondary - eTeens Programme</strong></h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>eTeens</em>&nbsp;is a programme developed by Health Promotion Board,
in collaboration with the Ministry of Education, to provide Secondary 3
students with accurate information on STIs, HIV and protection from a health
perspective.&nbsp;<em>eTeens</em>&nbsp;is conducted in two segments – a
mass talk segment and a classroom-based programme.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students are taught skills such as decision-making, assertiveness and
negotiation to say “no” to sex and negative peer pressure. They also learn
that the impact of STIs/HIV extends beyond themselves and involves their
family. Abstinence and upholding family values are the key messages. The
desired outcome of the&nbsp;<em>eTeens</em>&nbsp;programme is that students
are empowered to make wise, informed and sensible decisions.</p>
