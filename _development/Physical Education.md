<p>The<strong> </strong>Physical Education (PE) Department aims to develop
the physical, social, and emotional aspects of every student through a
diverse range of physical activities and programmes. The curriculum equips
students with the skills, knowledge, and positive attitudes necessary for
a lifelong, active, and healthy lifestyle.</p>

<p>Students are provided opportunities to enjoy and appreciate a wide variety
of sports and games, experience success in both team and individual settings,
assess their personal fitness, and design fitness programmes related to
total wellness. Our PE lessons emphasise fair play, teamwork, sportsmanship,
and safe practices during physical activity — all of which nurture Confident
Persons, Self-Directed Learners, Active Contributors, and Concerned Citizens,
which encompasses three interconnected pillars: Learning Content, Learning
Delivery, and Learning Assessment.</p>

<h3><strong>Delivery</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Joy of Learning, Lifelong Participation</strong></h4>
<p>Our PE programme inspires lifelong passion for health and wellness through:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>A student-centered, values-driven curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thoughtful integration of technology and authentic experiences</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Continuous growth across physical, emotional, and social domain</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Culminating Activities Across Levels</strong></h4>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/PE.png">
</div>
<p>To deepen learning and translate it into action, students participate
in progressive culminating tasks designed to apply their knowledge in authentic
contexts:</p>
<h4><strong>Junior High</strong></h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>A <strong>3D2N outdoor cohort camp</strong> (Year 1) develops resilience,
initiative, and collaborative skills in dynamic settings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Personal exercise planning (Year 2) encourages goal-setting, self-monitoring,
and personal responsibility in health.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <strong>4D3N outdoor adventure camp</strong> (Year 3) provides space for
leadership and adaptive decision-making in real-world scenarios.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Year 4 students design a <strong>two-month training programme</strong> targeting
cardiovascular endurance, muscular strength, or muscular endurance — applying
the Principles of Training and FITT<strong> </strong>Principle in a purposeful,
personalised way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Participation in <strong>at least three recreational competitions</strong> during
their junior high journey fosters strategic thinking, camaraderie, and
perseverance.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Senior High</strong></h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Completion of <strong>a personal or peer-directed wellness plan</strong>,
positioning students as active role models in their communities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Engagement in <strong>at least one recreational competition</strong>, demonstrating
confidence, initiative, and ownership of personal growth.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Junior High: Inter-Class Games, Sports Day &amp; Sports Education Programme</strong></h4>
<p>Our key events serve as more than just sporting competitions — they are
authentic platforms where students develop character, build relationships,
and grow as leaders:</p>
<p></p>
<p>In Year 4, the Baseball5 Inter-class Game forms a major feature of the
PE programme. More than just a game, it’s a structured experience where
students assume purposeful roles such as umpire, fielder, or team strategist.
Peer-led analysis, ICT tools like Baseball 9, and reflective practice enhance
decision-making, ownership, and teamwork in every game.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/archery.jpg">
</div>
<p>As part of our Sports Education Programme (managed by SportSG and MOE),
Year 2 students participate in Post-Exam Activities that introduce them
to non-curricular sports, extending learning beyond the classroom. Activities
such as Karate and Archery Tag offer engaging and character-rich experiences.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/IMG_4347.jpg">
</div>
<p></p>
<p>Through these authentic and immersive experiences, students grow into
individuals who embody what it means to care, serve, and lead — bringing
the school’s vision to life through action.</p>
<h4><strong>Senior High: D’Carnival Sports Event</strong></h4>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/IMG_7911.jpg">
</div>
<p>These opportunities are intentionally designed to stretch students in
ways that go beyond skill execution — nurturing habits of mind, strength
of character, and the joy of purposeful physical engagement.</p>
<p></p>

<h3><strong>Assessment</strong></h3>
<p>The PE department adopts a wide range of assessment modes to ensure that
students not only learn but grow holistically, in different modes and physical
domains, such as:</p>
