Our Humanities Talent Development provides opportunities for students who are passionate about exploring how people, processes, politics, cultures and events are connected and interwoven across space and time. The Humanities TD experiences will enhance students’ ability to observe, study and communicate his/her thoughts about our human condition and our place in the world.
