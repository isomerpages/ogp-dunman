Our STEM Talent Development creates a nurturing learning ecosystem for our STEM talents with in-house training for GEP special programmes and other external national and zonal platforms in Science and Mathematics research, Math & Science Olympiads, and Info-comm and Robotics competitions. Examples of STEM talent development avenues for our students include at Junior High (Secondary) level, the Science Mentorship Programme (**[SMP](https://www.moe.gov.sg/education/programmes/gifted-education-programme/special-programmes/science-mentorship-programmes)**), Innovation Programme (**[IvP](https://www.moe.gov.sg/education/programmes/gifted-education-programme/special-programmes/innovation-programme)**), Mathematics Research Programme (MRP), Research@Young Defence Scientists Programme (**[YDSP](https://www.dsta.gov.sg/join-us/student/young-defence-scientists-programme/)**), Engineering Innovation Challenge (**[EIC](https://www.science.edu.sg/for-schools/competitions/energy-innovation-challenge)**), hackathon events, Google Code-In or Splash Awards etc., and at Senior High (Junior College), Nanyang Research Programme (**[NRP](http://www.ntu.edu.sg/TalentOutreach/NRP/Pages/index.aspx)**) and Science Research Programme (**[SRP](https://www.moe.gov.sg/education/programmes/gifted-education-programme/special-programmes/science-research-programme)**) etc. Student participants showcase their research work, when selected, at platforms such as the ASTAR East Zone Science Fair, Singapore Mathematics Project Festival, Singapore Science and Engineering Fair (SSEF) or International Science and Engineering Fair (**ISEF**).

Partnerships are established with SUTD Research Mentorship Programme (**RMP**), ASTAR Institute of Materials Research Engineering (**IMRE**), ASTAR Nano-Bio Lab (**NBL**), Nano-Materials Research Lab at NUS Department of Physics, DSTA, DSO Labs, and established vendors to give Dunmanians first-class opportunities for exposure and growth. We also provide yearly exposure to our students on STEM developments overseas such as the Zhejiang University-University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Institute (**ZJUI**), the Kang Qiao Bilingual School in Taiwan, and the National Taiwan University.

We also provide in-house STEM TDP such as E2K and Eureka workshops, MakerEd@DHS Programme, Sports Science Research Programme (SSRP) and Financial Literacy workshops for interested students, as well as our very own STEM academic CCA, the STEM Collective, which comprises components like Info-comm Club, Robotics Club, Science Society and Mathematics Society. Members of the STEM Collective often initiate student workshops for their peers and juniors in an exercise of their academic leadership.
