Like an Odyssey voyage, Dunman High is the harbour for students to set sail and embark on a journey of passion pursuit and hone their 21st Century Competencies.

We believe every student should chart his or her own learning and embark on discovery of their passions and talents.

Elective Modules (EMs) are our way of providing a platform for Dunmanians to be self-directed in selecting learning options.  
  
They have the autonomy and ownership to choose what to learn and the depth of learning, according to their interests and aptitude.

Dunmanians are given a wide choice of EMs that spark their interests and deepen their passion in areas that range from interdisciplinary learning to subject-based research programmes.
