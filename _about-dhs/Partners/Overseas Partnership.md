## Australia (Narrogin Residential College)

Narrogin Residential College is one of Western Australia’s largest co-educational secondary boarding Colleges that can cater for up to 230 boarders. We provide boarding for students attending **Narrogin Senior High School** and for students (u18yrs) attending C Y O’Conner TAFE.

Students will also board with us up to year 10 with an intention to transfer to Narrogin Agricultural College for year 11 and 12. The College services primarily parents residing in the Wheat belt and Upper Great Southern region of WA. However, students from other areas of the state choose to board at the College. The College provides excellent care and supervision of its students and a full range of sporting and recreational activities. In addition to this students are supported with their academic and pastoral care needs. All this is provided by our dedicated team of full-time Boarding Supervisors.

## Australia-City Beach Residential College

The Country High School Hostels Authority has gained the use of a superb boarding facility to house gifted and talented students offered places at Perth Modern School and other schools offering programs for gifted and talented students.



It is situated in Kalinda Drive in City Beach (just off Oceanic Drive) and is located in a safe and secure bushland setting on the former City Beach Senior High School site.

The boarding facility was built some years ago for students attending the International School prior to its recent closure.  The students live in modern student accommodation and have access to all of the recreation facilities established on this site for the City Beach Senior High School and International School students.

Accommodation is in a six-room unit that has an independent kitchen/dining room and lounge and three bathrooms.  A computer with internet access is available as well as internet access for personal or laptop computers.

There are fifteen units in the complex with supervisory staff close at hand to guide, help and care for the students out of school hours.

The recreational facilities are first class with most interests or pursuits catered for either on site or in close proximity.  The campus has a football oval, soccer and hockey pitch, cricket nets, tennis courts, basketball and netball courts.  The on-site gymnasium houses two basketball courts and can be used for badmington, indoor soccer, cricket, hockey and Tai Kwon Do.

The City of Perth Beach and Floreat Beach are both within walking distance of the residential college, and the sporting facilities of Perry Lakes and Challenge Stadium are also nearby.  Two public swimming pools are within a kilometre of the college grounds.
