In celebration of **[DHS 55th Anniversary](https://dunmanhigh.moe.edu.sg/about-dhs/school-history/dhs-55th-anniversary/)** and the opening of our new campus in 2011, the Humanities Department has put together a booklet titled ‘**The Dunman High Story**’ which traces our school history from 14 October 1956 to the present.

The Dunman High Story contains interesting anecdotal accounts of both staff and students which we interviewed. Several of the stories were taken from The Straits Times and Nanyang Siang Pau, oral transcripts from the National Archives of Singapore and the National Library and translations of Chinese articles of the school’s publications in the 1960s and 1970s.  These materials have given us a better insight and at the same time highlighted the key milestones events of Dunman High School.
