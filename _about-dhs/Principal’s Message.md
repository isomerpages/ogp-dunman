A very warm welcome to Dunman High School!
	
	
As a choice school for secondary and pre-university education, Dunman High strives to provide quality learning and all-round development to our students, preparing them to be future-ready and empowering them to be Leaders of Honour and distinction. Students joining the school after their Primary School Leaving Examination can look forward to develop their talents and stretch their potential through our 6-year Integrated Programme; and those joining us after the GCE Ordinary-Level Examination will spend 2 years in our warm and vibrant learning environment to further hone their talents and realise their potential. 
	
Since our inception in 1956, Dunman High has been committed to our mission of providing every Dumanian a quality education anchored on strong values. Over the years, we are proud to have produced generations of Dunmanians who are leaders of society and pillars of our nation. It is heartening to see all Dunmanians are guided by the School Motto of  诚、信、勇、忠 Honesty, Trustworthiness, Moral Courage and Loyalty in every of their life endeavours and undertakings. Indeed, the school believes in providing Dunmanians the learning experiences to put values into action – the action to Care, to Serve, and to Lead, and empowering them to actualise self and inspire others.
	
	
As a school of distinction, Dunman High has excelled in the various domains of education. These achievements are the hard work of our people. We are proud to have a highly dedicated team of staff who are always there for the students and the school. They are driven by a strong sense of mission to nurture every student. Serving as role-models to the young minds, they have inspired in every Dunmanian the passion in learning for life and the commitment to leading self and serving others. With great honour, we salute our teachers and school staff!
	
The school is also grateful for the strong support and partnership from the larger Dunman High family which includes our Parent Support Group, the Alumni and the School Advisory Committee. They have been instrumental in helping the school to garner useful insights and strategic resources for organisational growth and development. We are proud that the close-knit relationships within the Dunman High family is underscored by a deep sense of conviction to achieve the common goal of empowering every generation of Dunmanians to lead with honour.

	
The rich heritage and stellar achievements of Dunman High have inspired us in our endeavours in education. In the journey forward, we are appreciative of the fast changing landscape. There will be new challenges and disruptions. Alongside them will be new opportunities and responsibilities. I am confident that the Dunman High family will always keep our spirit high and demonstrate a strong sense of unity in breaking new grounds and scaling new heights!
	
Thank You.

热烈欢迎大家来到德明政府中学！
	

作为中学和初院的首选学府，德明致力于为学生提供优质的教育，让他们得以全面发展，为未来做好准备，并赋予他们成为荣誉和杰出领袖的能力。在小学离校考试后加入德明的学生，将在为期六年的综合课程的帮助下，发展才能，发挥潜力；而那些在教育部联合招生计划下加入我们的同学，将在德明温暖友爱、充满活力的学习环境中度过两年，进一步磨炼意志，成就梦想。
	

自 1956 年成立以来，德明一直把为每个德明人提供基于强大价值观的优质教育视为己任。多年来，我们以培养了一代又一代优秀的德明人为豪。他们是社会的领导者，是国家的栋梁。令人欣慰的是，所有德明人都在“诚、信、勇、忠”的校训的指引下，坚实地迈出人生的每一步。事实上，学校为德明人提供了丰富的学习体验，使之将优良的价值观付诸行动，在完成“关怀、服务和领导”使命的实践中，提升自我，激励他人。


作为一所顶尖学府，德明在各个领域都表现出色。各项成就的取得，离不开教职员工的群策群力。我们为拥有一支永远把学生和学校利益放在第一位的、高度敬业的员工团队而自豪。他们有着强烈的使命感和责任感，积极培养每一位学生。作为年轻人心中的榜样，他们激发了每位德明人对终身学习的热情，激励他们去领导自我、服务他人。让我们一起，向辛勤敬业的教职员工们致敬！ 


当然，学校的发展也离不开德明大家庭中其他成员的鼎力相助，这些成员包括：学校咨询委员会，家长支持会以及校友会。他们为学校的发展壮大，提供了高瞻远瞩的指导和策略资源，居功至伟。令我们骄傲的是，德明大家庭的成员紧密团结，齐心协力，为实现让每一代德明人都成为荣誉领袖的共同目标而努力不懈。


德明丰富的传统和卓越的成就，时刻激励着我们在教育的道路上精益求精，不断进步。在前行的过程中，我们对瞬息万变的时代心存感激。因为挑战与机遇并存，危机和契机同在，伴随变化而来的，是崭新的机会和更大的责任。我坚信，德明人将携手并肩，永远积极向上，开拓新天地，再攀新高峰！


谢谢大家！
