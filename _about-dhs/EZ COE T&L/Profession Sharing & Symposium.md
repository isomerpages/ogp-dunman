East Zone Centre of Excellence for Teaching & Learning (EZ COE T&L) Professional Sharing Day 2021 was successfully organised by Dunman High School and the EZ COE T&L on 30 July 2021.

This year’s event, based on the theme ‘Engaging Teachers, Transforming Learning’, involved 34 concurrent sessions led by teachers from 25 schools across the East Zone. The event was very well-received, with over 400 educators from schools and the Academy of Singapore Teachers (AST) participating online.

Our Guest-of-Honour this year was Mr Justine Pierre, Cluster Superintendent (Schools/East 4). Reflecting on the theme in his Opening Remarks, Mr Pierre observed that changes in the evolving education landscape have been hastened by external factors, such as the COVID- 19 pandemic and technological advances. Against this backdrop, meaningful transformation has also been taking place in the classrooms through the daily refinements teachers make to improve their practices, and the regular reflections they undertake to hone their craft. This transformation, though less dramatic than the headline events of the past two years, would reap exponential returns when like-minded professionals engage in sharing and collective learning to propagate good practices across schools. Mr Pierre’s observation underscored the importance of the day’s event, which was organised, despite the challenging circumstances, precisely to provide the platform to facilitate professional dialogue and the exchange of ideas among educators.

The concurrent sessions which followed Mr Pierre’s Opening Remarks provided participants with a valuable opportunity for professional engagement and meaningful bonding over the sharing of insights and practical tips on teaching and learning. One participant commented that she was glad to learn about technological tools which she found useful for teaching and learning. Another participant highlighted the hands-on activities shared by the presenters which enabled participants to better understand the learning needs of their students and refine their lessons to address these needs. The EZ COE T&L looks forward to providing a variety of platforms for East Zone teachers to come together to grow and learn in 2022.
