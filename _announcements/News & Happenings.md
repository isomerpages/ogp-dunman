<p>Students would be able to appreciate the beauty of Mathematics in the various strands through derivation and understanding of concepts. They would also make connections across Mathematical topics and the other disciplines through integration with subjects such as Physics and Aesthetics.&nbsp; In addition, the curriculum seeks to engage students in the application of Mathematics in real life situations so as to enrich their appreciation of the subject. This is done through Mathematical Modeling, a process which requires students to represent or describe real world problems mathematically. The aim is to find a real world solution or gain a better understanding of the problem.&nbsp; At the end of Junior High, students develop the skills to reason, to communicate mathematically, and to learn cooperatively.</p>
<p>At Senior High, our students have the option to offer H1 Mathematics or H2 Mathematics for their GCE &lsquo;A&rsquo; Level examinations. The curriculum continues to develop our students&rsquo; mathematical thinking and problem solving skills, with an emphasis on conceptual understanding and skills in reasoning, applications and modelling with the use of technology. Students will have opportunities to conjecture, discover and reason in mathematics. For those who show passion and the aptitude to go further in Mathematics, they can choose to offer MOE-H3 Mathematics or NUS Linear Algebra. These programmes allow students to further develop their mathematical modelling and reasoning skills. Students will also learn the process of mathematical modelling for real-world problems, which involves making informed assumptions, validation and prediction.</p>
<p>Through our collaborations with organizations such as the Gifted Education Branch, Ministry of Education, Singapore Mathematics Society and our overseas partners, students have opportunities to undergo tailored training programmes and participate in various international and nation-wide mathematics competitions, such as the Singapore Mathematics Olympiad, American Mathematics Competition, Australian Mathematics Competition, Singapore Mathematical Society Project Festival.</p>
