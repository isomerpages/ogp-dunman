<p>Students are given opportunities for discovery learning and open-ended problem solving to enable them to develop higher level thinking skills in our six-year course. In Lower Secondary, various games and activities are also incorporated into the pedagogical methodologies in order to better engage students and allow them to develop appreciation for the subject. As most of these and many other Math-related projects involve group work, students are also given the opportunity to learn collaboratively. These collaborations are not only learning opportunities, they are also good platforms for our students to develop an invaluable skill of being able to work in teams.</p>
<p>Our programme aims to develop the essential process, mathematical thinking and problem solving skills that students require to solve problems. They are taught to recognize and use connections among mathematical ideas and to develop a positive attitude towards Mathematics. We make use of a variety of information and communication technology tools in our lessons to further enhance students&rsquo; learning.</p>
<p>Being a school offering an Integrated Programme allows us to have holistic and comprehensive programmes in the teaching and learning of Mathematics. We fully explore the advantages of spiral-building up of skills in Mathematics throughout the six years and provide opportunities for students to see the applications of Mathematics in their daily lessons. Talented students explore research projects and participate in national competitions that require knowledge spanning across the two disciplines.</p>

<p>他们也可在这6年里有许多发掘学习和解答开放式问题的机会，从而培养更强的思考能力。我们也在初中低年级的课程里融入了各种游戏和活动，以提升学生的参与度和让他们对科目有更好的认识。由于大多数的数学专题作业都是以小组形式进行，因此学生不仅能学习知识，也可以加强他们在团队合作时所需的各种技巧。</p>
<p>本学科旨在培育数学思考和问题解决的技能。学生除了学习识别和应用不同数学课项之间的存在关系外，也同时加深对数学的喜好。除此之外，课程也广泛地运用多种信息和通讯技术来提升学生的学习效率。</p>
<p>身为直通车计划的学府之一，我校秉持着为学生提供一个更全面的教育体验的使命，数学部也不例外。本部门利用螺旋式的课程架构，在六年内为学生打下良好的数学基础，并让他们亲身体验数学在日常生活的应用。此外，我们也提供机会让有才华的学生参与跨学科的探索研究活动以及全国比赛等。</p>

**Assessment 评估与测试**

Other than pen-and-paper tests, the Mathematics Programme places emphasis on alternative assessment which focus on the conceptual understanding of what has been learned.

除了例常笔试外，本课程的评估方式也包涵其他类型，以更全面地测试学生对所学概念的理解。

<p>Students would be able to appreciate the beauty of Mathematics in the various strands through derivation and understanding of concepts. They would also make connections across Mathematical topics and the other disciplines through integration with subjects such as Physics and Aesthetics.&nbsp; In addition, the curriculum seeks to engage students in the application of Mathematics in real life situations so as to enrich their appreciation of the subject. This is done through Mathematical Modeling, a process which requires students to represent or describe real world problems mathematically. The aim is to find a real world solution or gain a better understanding of the problem.&nbsp; At the end of Junior High, students develop the skills to reason, to communicate mathematically, and to learn cooperatively.</p>
<p>At Senior High, our students have the option to offer H1 Mathematics or H2 Mathematics for their GCE &lsquo;A&rsquo; Level examinations. The curriculum continues to develop our students&rsquo; mathematical thinking and problem solving skills, with an emphasis on conceptual understanding and skills in reasoning, applications and modelling with the use of technology. Students will have opportunities to conjecture, discover and reason in mathematics. For those who show passion and the aptitude to go further in Mathematics, they can choose to offer MOE-H3 Mathematics or NUS Linear Algebra. These programmes allow students to further develop their mathematical modelling and reasoning skills. Students will also learn the process of mathematical modelling for real-world problems, which involves making informed assumptions, validation and prediction.</p>
<p>Through our collaborations with organizations such as the Gifted Education Branch, Ministry of Education, Singapore Mathematics Society and our overseas partners, students have opportunities to undergo tailored training programmes and participate in various international and nation-wide mathematics competitions, such as the Singapore Mathematics Olympiad, American Mathematics Competition, Australian Mathematics Competition, Singapore Mathematical Society Project Festival.</p>
