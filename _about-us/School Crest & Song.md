<h1><strong>School Crest</strong></h1>
<p>The school crest was designed by the late Mr Chen Jen Hao, a former principal
of the school and Mr Liu Kang, a former art teacher, who was a well-known
pioneer in the local art scene.</p>
<p>The name De Ming (德明) in Chinese is not merely a translation from the
name ‘Dunman’.&nbsp; It also draws meaning from the first line of a Confucian
classic, ‘Da Xue’ (大学 ) which states that the main objective of education
is to help people manifest the virtues and morals that are already inherent
in them (大学之道在明明德).</p>

<p>The two characters (德明) in the crest written in ‘Zhuan’ (篆) calligraphy
style is the work of Mr Chen Jen Hao.&nbsp; The Chinese ‘Zhuan’ (篆) calligraphy
is ornamental in character and has a history of over 2000 years.&nbsp;
Thus it embodies the idea of preserving a tradition.&nbsp; This symbolizes
the school ethos, which is, building on and fostering traditional values.</p>
<p>The red symbolizes passion and striving for success.&nbsp; The blue signifies
peace and dignity while the circular border represents wholeness and unity,
and symbolizes the pursuit of universality, derived from the classic ‘Liji
Daxue’ (《礼记•大学》).</p>
<h2><strong>School Song</strong></h2>
<p>德明中学&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 矗立加东
<br>亭亭松影&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 习习海风
<br>集我英才&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 汇于一家
<br>文艺科学&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 同冶同攻
<br>树模楷&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 教诚信
<br>立风范&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 诲勇忠
<br>吾学兮博通&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 吾德兮高崇
<br>师生共陶镕&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 浩气干长空
<br>爱护我德明&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 永志乎五中
<br>光大我德明&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 永志乎五中</p>
