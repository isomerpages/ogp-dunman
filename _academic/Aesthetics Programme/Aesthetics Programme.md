Since the inception of A level MEP and AEP in 2007, many of our students have excelled in the subjects and been awarded the Music Elective Programme Scholarship, MOE Overseas Teaching Scholarship for Music and Art, and NUS Global Merit Scholarship for Architecture.  

#### **Music & Art**

Music and Art aim to engage all Year Ones and Two students in arts and culture. Students get to appreciate music and art better, enjoy ethnic and digital music creation, and express themselves in various art forms. 

#### **Music Elective Programme**
The Dunman High School Music Elective Programme (MEP) was introduced by the MOE in 1982. It offers musically-talented students a choice of either a 4-year GCE ‘O’ Level or a 6-year GCE ‘A’ Level programme. Adopting a holistic approach towards music teaching and learning, and led by our highly qualified team of music educators, MEP students are nurtured to be independent learners and musicians as they constantly improve on their musical skills, and deepen their understanding of and appreciation of music. They would be taught to analyse music of both Western and Asian traditions, and be equipped with musical composition and performing skills.

#### **Art Special Programme (ASP)**
The Art Special Programme (ASP) is offered from Year One to Year Four. It aims to expose artistically inclined students to a wide range of art forms supported by a deep understanding and appreciation of the visual arts. In line with our holistic approach to visual arts education, ASP students are strongly encouraged to apply their knowledge of art history and artists from the Study of Visual Arts into Studio Practice such as Painting, Sculpture, Digital Video, Installation, and Mixed Media. Students can choose to further their Art education in Senior High with the options of taking Art as a H1 or H2 subject.

#### **Lifeskills Programme (LSP)**
The unique Lifeskills Programme (LSP) is offered at Year One and Two students. It focuses on teaching practical life skills that range from cookery, nutrition, food product development, food safety and sewing to emergency preparedness.

自2007年高中部推出音乐特选与美术特选课程至今，我校已有多名学生获颁音乐特选课程奖学金，教育部海外奖学金（音乐/美术教学），以及新加坡国立大学国际优异奖学金（建筑学）。这些成绩都是美学部门不懈努力的最好见证。

#### **普通音乐课程和普通美术课程**

以上课程的宗旨，是让所有的中一和中二年级学生都接受基本的艺术和文化教育。在此课程中，学生能学习如何更好地欣赏音乐和美术作品，体验民族音乐和数码音乐创作，并且有机会利用各种艺术形态来表达自己。

#### **音乐特选课程 (MEP)**

德明政府中学在1982年正式受教育部委任开办音乐特选课程（MEP）。此课程让有音乐天赋的学 生，选择4年的剑桥‘O’水准课程或6年的剑桥 ‘A’水准课程。课程由我校高素质的音乐教育工作者领军，并采用全方位的教学模式开展。学生在这优良环境中，学习如何成为独立的学习者和音乐演奏者，借 此进一步加强自己的音乐技巧和鉴赏能力。学生除了能分析和学习西方与亚洲音乐外，也将习得作曲和演奏的技能。

#### **音乐特选课美术特选课程（ASP)**
此课程让学生有机会修读美术，并可参加剑桥’A’水准的美术会考。课程让有天赋的学生接触多种美术形态，并培养高层次的理解和欣赏能力。本校也采用全方位的教学模式，大力鼓励学生把美术历史和理论实践在绘画、雕塑、数码录像、装置及混合媒介艺术等领域中。

**生活技能学科（****LSP****）**  
本学科专为中一和中二年级的学生而设。它侧重于教育终身生活技能、如烹饪、饮食营养、缝纫和紧急应变步骤等。

### **Pedagogy 教学法**

Due to the disposition of the Aesthetic subjects, Music, Art and Lifeskills provide many engaging hands-on and collaborative learning experiences.Workshops, master-classes, concerts and exhibitions are organized regularly to further develop students’ understanding and appreciation of the subjects.

For the academic subjects, pedagogies such as Lectures, Peer-teaching and Socratic questionings are also infused into the MEP and ASP curriculum.

美学部的学科（音乐，美术和生活技能）提供学生许多实际与具合作性质的学习经验。此外，本校也定期主办工作坊、名师指导班、演奏、展览以进一步提升学生对学科内容的理解和欣赏。

会考学科方面，则学校将讲座教学法、互教互学法与苏格拉底式的提问方式注入音乐和美术特选课程中。
