### **Curriculum 课程内容**
In Dunman High School, the study of Humanities emphasizes an attitude of questioning and learning through critical reflection to improve students’ communication skills and give them a greater understanding of the world.

Adopting the Understanding by Design (Wiggins and McTighe) approach, the Humanities Department seeks to enable students to have a deep understanding of each discipline within the Humanities Programme. Overarching, big ideas are emphasized.

Teaching is carried out with purposeful use of essential questions to guide the crafting of performance tasks and the planning of lessons. Emphasis has shifted from covering the content, to uncovering the core of each discipline to enable students to explore the depth of each subject.

在德明政府中学，人文课程强调通过提问和测试来加强学生的批判性思考能力，也借此提高他们的沟通技巧和对世界的认识与理解。

本校采用Wiggins和McTighe 所研发的逆向课程设计模Understanding by Design，以此指导学生对各科目做深入的探讨。此模式强调对主题的理解，而在教学中以重点问题为主轴，来设计各种教学材料和学生作业。这个学习方式注重启发学生对每个学科核心的认识，让学生深度探索各个学科。

The **Understanding by Design (UbD)** approach enables learners to

*   reach a deeper and longer-term understanding,
*   discover how key concepts relate to their lives,
*   see how the past is connected to the present,
*   apply their knowledge to the world around them, and
*   make meaningful connections across the subjects and academic years.

#### 1. Active Citizenry Education
The ACE team in DHS uses Understanding By Design (UbD) as the main curriculum design framework to design learning experience for students to explore six themes including: 

1. Singapore as a Nation in the World
2. Conflict and Harmony in Multi-Ethnic Societies 
3. Understanding Governance
4. Sustaining Economic Development
5. Facing Challenges and (6) Managing International Relations. Each unit is framed with a set of essential questions and students go through a series of lessons and tasks in order to reach an enduring understanding of the topic.

#### 2. Economics
'A’ Level Economics aims to equip students with an understanding of fundamental economic concepts, theories and principles, and develop in students the ability to use the tools and methods of economic reasoning to analyse real-world economic issues from multiple perspectives. Students are expected to be engaged in discussions to arrive at informed and reasoned conclusions on contemporary economic issues in Singapore and beyond.

#### 3. Geography
The study of Geography centres on humans and the environment around us, it basically teaches students ‘to have a greater understanding of the world they work, communicate, learn, and live in’ (Teachnology Inc., 2011).

#### 4. History
The teaching of History has moved beyond the transmission of content to inculcating historical thinking and understanding in which concepts skills and knowledge of history is critically applied in contemporary or historical issues.
