<h3><strong>Curriculum</strong></h3>
<p>Rooted in the study of human experiences, cultures, histories, and environments,
the DHS Humanities curriculum adopts inquiry-based and constructivist approaches
to promote curiosity, independent thinking, and engagement with real-world
issues. Spanning Active Citizenship Education, Economics, Geography, and
History, the Humanities curriculum is forward-looking and responsive to
the evolving needs of society.</p>

<p><strong>Active Citizenry Education (ACE)</strong>
</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>The Active Citizenry Education (ACE) syllabus at Junior High (Year 1-4)
adopts a values-driven, inquiry-based approach where students are encouraged
to think critically about societal issues, reflect on their roles in a
diverse world, and take ownership of their learning. They develop critical
thinking, appreciate diverse perspectives, and become reflective learners.
Core skills such as the ability to evaluate sources, detect bias, and discern
truth promote informed decision-making, responsible citizenship, and independent
thought. Our dynamic, real-world curriculum connects students to local
and global challenges, fostering civic responsibility and social awareness.</p>

<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>At Dunman High School, the study of Geography and History cultivates confident,
self-directed learners, active contributors, and concerned citizens. Students
explore complex relationships between people, places, and time and develop
critical thinking, research, and communication skills to engage meaningfully
with real-world challenges. Geography equips students with the tools to
understand environmental interdependence and issues such as climate change
and sustainable development, while History deepens their understanding
of global and regional transformations through key themes like Rise and
Fall of Colonial Empires, the Development of the Cold War and 20th Century
Conflicts. Both curricula emphasise analytical thinking, digital literacy,
and global awareness, empowering students to make informed decisions and
contribute to a sustainable and inclusive future.</p>

<p><strong>Economics</strong>

<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>At the core of the learning of Economics in Dunman High School at Senior
High (Y5-6) is the Decision-Making Approach which guides disciplinary thinking.
This approach emphasises Sound Reasoning and Decision-Making, supporting
the development of Critical and Inventive Thinking. It enables students
to evaluate how economic agents make decisions based on the fundamental
disciplinary concepts of scarcity, choice and opportunity costs, and to
apply this understanding to analyse domestic, regional and global economic
issues. Through analysing wide ranging economic issues such as climate
change and technological disruptions, the syllabus also aims to build the
values of responsibility, resilience and empathy.</p>

<h3><strong>Delivery</strong></h3>
<p>At DHS, Humanities programmes are delivered through a dynamic, inquiry-based,
and student-centred approach. Lessons are intentionally designed to be
interactive, authentic, and reflective, enabling students to take ownership
of their learning and actively construct knowledge.</p>
<p></p>

</div>
<p>Across subjects, lesson delivery incorporates a variety of strategies
such as role-play, debates, group discussions and projects. These approaches
are complemented by experiential learning opportunities like fieldwork,
learning journeys, and investigative tasks that connect academic content
to real-world contexts. Digital platforms enhance engagement, allowing
students to analyse data, explore diverse perspectives, and construct knowledge
by forming evidence-based conclusions.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Across all subjects, lesson delivery emphasises reflection, independence,
and collaborationâ€”equipping students to be thoughtful inquirers, engaged
citizens, and adaptable, future-ready learners. Humanities lessons at DHS
are crafted not just to impart knowledge, but to nurture reflective inquirers,
engaged citizens, and future-ready learners prepared to navigate and contribute
meaningfully to a complex, interconnected world.</p>

<h3><strong>Assessment&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>At the heart of our assessment philosophy is the belief that assessment
should inspire growth, reflection, and a lifelong love for learning. Through
the intentional design of assessments, we aim for students to develop core
skills such as critical thinking and communication, and sustain their curiosity,
build independence, and deepen their appreciation of the world.</p>

</div>
<p></p>
<p>To support this, we employ a variety of authentic and reflective assessment
strategies such as fieldwork, reflecting on diverse perspectives and communicating
these insights through a multitude of media such as forum letters, videos,
podcasts, infographics, reports and essays. Our assessments support continuous
learning and development through class practices, quizzes, peer and self-assessments,
and sample marking. Students receive timely feedback that informs their
learning and encourages ownership of their academic growth. These practices
encourage metacognition, helping students monitor their own thinking and
continuously improve their learning.</p>
