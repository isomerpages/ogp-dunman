The design of the Dunman High Programme is guided by the school’s Philosophy of Education, which forms the basis of what we do, how we do and why we do in Dunman High to provide a forward-looking education for our students.

以教育哲学为指引的德明综合课程，本着做什么、怎么做和为什么做的考量，为学生提供具有前瞻性的教育。

**Philosophy of Education 教育哲学**

In Dunman High School, we view character and cognitive development as fundamental to the holistic education of our students.

We seek to equip every Dunmanian with the disposition and competencies needed to thrive in an increasingly complex world.  We believe every student should have the ability to collaborate well, think critically and creatively, and communicate effectively in both English and Chinese.

In line with Confucian philosophy and our values of honesty, trustworthiness, moral courage and loyalty, we strive to nurture Dunmanians with a passion for life and learning. We are committed to developing active citizens who care deeply for others, have a heart to serve, and take the lead to change the world for the better.

德明政府中学向来把发展学生的品格和认知作为全人教育的基础。

发展每个德明人的性情和能力，使之能在这个日益复杂的世界里茁壮成长，这是我们孜孜以求的目标。我们坚信，每个学生都应该拥有和他人携手合作的能力，能进行批判性和创造性思考，能以双语有效沟通。

秉持着儒家思想及德明的校训——诚、信、勇、忠，我们努力激发德明人对生活和学习的热情。我们希望每个德明人都拥有积极的公民意识，关怀他人，以服务民众为己任，并能够领导社群创造更美好的世界。

**Key Approaches 课程策略**

The four key approaches adopted in the Dunman High Programme are:

1\. Integrated and Interdisciplinary 综合理解与跨学科学习  
2\. Innovative Teaching & Learning 创新教学与学习  
3\. Multiple Modes of Assessment 多元化的评鉴方式  
4\. Student-Centred 以学生为中心的教学

These approaches undergird the Dunman High academic curriculum. Our academic curriculum is structured around the Bicultural Studies Programme, the Humanities & Aesthetics Programme, the Mathematics & Science Programme and the Knowledge Skills Programme. Coupled with the student development curriculum, the school’s holistic education aims to support our students in acquiring Dunmanian Outcomes.
