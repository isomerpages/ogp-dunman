### **Curriculum 课程内容**
The Mathematics programme in Dunman High School spans across six years. Our content is aligned to ensure that students move from Junior High to Senior High seamlessly and the content coverage extends beyond the basic syllabus in breadth and depth.

本校6年数学课程不但连贯初中与高中，在内容上也比一般基础课程更深广。

In Junior High, the curriculum is built upon the major strands of Mathematics such as Numbers and Algebra, Trigonometry, Geometry, Calculus, Graphing Techniques and Statistics.

在初中部分，数学课程是围绕主要的数学领域所设计，例如数目和代数、三角、几何、微积分学、制图技巧和统计学。课程注重数学概念的理解和问题解答，从而让学生体味数学的奥妙，并探索数学与其他学科（如物理，美学等等）的密切关系。

Students would be able to appreciate the beauty of Mathematics in the various strands through derivation and understanding of concepts. They would also make connections across Mathematical topics and the other disciplines through integration with subjects such as Physics and Aesthetics.  In addition, the curriculum seeks to engage students in the application of Mathematics in real life situations so as to enrich their appreciation of the subject. This is done through Mathematical Modeling, a process which requires students to represent or describe real world problems mathematically. The aim is to find a real world solution or gain a better understanding of the problem.  At the end of Junior High, students develop the skills to reason, to communicate mathematically, and to learn cooperatively.

At Senior High, our students have the option to offer H1 Mathematics or H2 Mathematics for their GCE ‘A’ Level examinations. The curriculum continues to develop our students’ mathematical thinking and problem solving skills, with an emphasis on conceptual understanding and skills in reasoning, applications and modelling with the use of technology. Students will have opportunities to conjecture, discover and reason in mathematics. For those who show passion and the aptitude to go further in Mathematics, they can choose to offer MOE-H3 Mathematics or NUS Linear Algebra. These programmes allow students to further develop their mathematical modelling and reasoning skills. Students will also learn the process of mathematical modelling for real-world problems, which involves making informed assumptions, validation and prediction.

Through our collaborations with organizations such as the Gifted Education Branch, Ministry of Education, Singapore Mathematics Society and our overseas partners, students have opportunities to undergo tailored training programmes and participate in various international and nation-wide mathematics competitions, such as the Singapore Mathematics Olympiad, American Mathematics Competition, Australian Mathematics Competition, Singapore Mathematical Society Project Festival.

Apart from the Mathematics Curriculum, all Upper Secondary students also attend compulsory Financial Literacy lessons structured within their formal curriculum time. Through these lessons, students learn about the importance of financial literacy. They will be taught good financial habits and these invaluable life skills can prepare the students to acquire sound values which will take them through life as responsible adults and active citizens. They are also exposed to the basic concept of time value of money and the fundamentals of the foreign exchange market. At the end of the Financial Literacy modules, students are also given the opportunity to embark on a trip to Asia countries to learn more about finance and entrepreneurship.

### **Pedagogy 教学法**
The Mathematics Programme tailors our teaching environment and practices to cater for different learning experiences for our students. By integrating out-of-class experiences and different subject disciplines in our programme, it encourages the investigation of real-life problems.

本校以具区分性的教学环境和方式让学生们有不同的学习经验。课程融合课堂以外的学习和其他不同的学科知识，来鼓励学生对现 实生活中的问题进行探索。

Students are given opportunities for discovery learning and open-ended problem solving to enable them to develop higher level thinking skills in our six-year course. In Lower Secondary, various games and activities are also incorporated into the pedagogical methodologies in order to better engage students and allow them to develop appreciation for the subject. As most of these and many other Math-related projects involve group work, students are also given the opportunity to learn collaboratively. These collaborations are not only learning opportunities, they are also good platforms for our students to develop an invaluable skill of being able to work in teams.

Our programme aims to develop the essential process, mathematical thinking and problem solving skills that students require to solve problems. They are taught to recognize and use connections among mathematical ideas and to develop a positive attitude towards Mathematics. We make use of a variety of information and communication technology tools in our lessons to further enhance students’ learning.

Being a school offering an Integrated Programme allows us to have holistic and comprehensive programmes in the teaching and learning of Mathematics. We fully explore the advantages of spiral-building up of skills in Mathematics throughout the six years and provide opportunities for students to see the applications of Mathematics in their daily lessons. Talented students explore research projects and participate in national competitions that require knowledge spanning across the two disciplines.

他们也可在这6年里有许多发掘学习和解答开放式问题的机会，从而培养更强的思考能力。我们也在初中低年级的课程里融入了各种游戏和活动，以提升学生的参与度和让他们对科目有更好的认识。由于大多数的数学专题作业都是以小组形式进行，因此学生不仅能学习知识，也可以加强他们在团队合作时所需的各种技巧。

本学科旨在培育数学思考和问题解决的技能。学生除了学习识别和应用不同数学课项之间的存在关系外，也同时加深对数学的喜好。除此之外，课程也广泛地运用多种信息和通讯技术来提升学生的学习效率。

身为直通车计划的学府之一，我校秉持着为学生提供一个更全面的教育体验的使命，数学部也不例外。本部门利用螺旋式的课程架构，在六年内为学生打下良好的数学基础，并让他们亲身体验数学在日常生活的应用。此外，我们也提供机会让有才华的学生参与跨学科的探索研究活动以及全国比赛等。


### **Assessment 评估与测试**
Other than pen-and-paper tests, the Mathematics Programme places emphasis on alternative assessment which focus on the conceptual understanding of what has been learned.

除了例常笔试外，本课程的评估方式也包涵其他类型，以更全面地测试学生对所学概念的理解。

In the midst of their learning, students are also given authentic tasks which allow them to apply what they have learnt in the classroom to the world outside.

Examples of alternative assessment include interdisciplinary projects such as creating a rain gauge or cereal box, Viva Voce (Oral presentation), creative problem posing and solving as well as mathematical games and modelling. Other examples include writing a proposal for a modified Health and Fitness Indicator, and using a software to determine the minimum surface area of a solid figure.

一些跨学科的真实评估包括雨量计和麦片盒的制作，口述报告，创意问题的提问与解答，以及各类数学游戏和建模活动等。其他例子还包括为改良后的健康和体能指示器草拟计划书，以及使用软件来鉴定一个固体的最小面积。
