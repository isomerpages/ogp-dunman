### **Curriculum 课程内容**
The Mathematics programme in Dunman High School spans across six years. Our content is aligned to ensure that students move from Junior High to Senior High seamlessly and the content coverage extends beyond the basic syllabus in breadth and depth.

本校6年数学课程不但连贯初中与高中，在内容上也比一般基础课程更深广。

In Junior High, the curriculum is built upon the major strands of Mathematics such as Numbers and Algebra, Trigonometry, Geometry, Calculus, Graphing Techniques and Statistics.

在初中部分，数学课程是围绕主要的数学领域所设计，例如数目和代数、三角、几何、微积分学、制图技巧和统计学。课程注重数学概念的理解和问题解答，从而让学生体味数学的奥妙，并探索数学与其他学科（如物理，美学等等）的密切关系。

Students would be able to appreciate the beauty of Mathematics in the various strands through derivation and understanding of concepts. They would also make connections across Mathematical topics and the other disciplines through integration with subjects such as Physics and Aesthetics.  In addition, the curriculum seeks to engage students in the application of Mathematics in real life situations so as to enrich their appreciation of the subject. This is done through Mathematical Modeling, a process which requires students to represent or describe real world problems mathematically. The aim is to find a real world solution or gain a better understanding of the problem.  At the end of Junior High, students develop the skills to reason, to communicate mathematically, and to learn cooperatively.

At Senior High, our students have the option to offer H1 Mathematics or H2 Mathematics for their GCE ‘A’ Level examinations. The curriculum continues to develop our students’ mathematical thinking and problem solving skills, with an emphasis on conceptual understanding and skills in reasoning, applications and modelling with the use of technology. Students will have opportunities to conjecture, discover and reason in mathematics. For those who show passion and the aptitude to go further in Mathematics, they can choose to offer MOE-H3 Mathematics or NUS Linear Algebra. These programmes allow students to further develop their mathematical modelling and reasoning skills. Students will also learn the process of mathematical modelling for real-world problems, which involves making informed assumptions, validation and prediction.

Through our collaborations with organizations such as the Gifted Education Branch, Ministry of Education, Singapore Mathematics Society and our overseas partners, students have opportunities to undergo tailored training programmes and participate in various international and nation-wide mathematics competitions, such as the Singapore Mathematics Olympiad, American Mathematics Competition, Australian Mathematics Competition, Singapore Mathematical Society Project Festival.

Apart from the Mathematics Curriculum, all Upper Secondary students also attend compulsory Financial Literacy lessons structured within their formal curriculum time. Through these lessons, students learn about the importance of financial literacy. They will be taught good financial habits and these invaluable life skills can prepare the students to acquire sound values which will take them through life as responsible adults and active citizens. They are also exposed to the basic concept of time value of money and the fundamentals of the foreign exchange market. At the end of the Financial Literacy modules, students are also given the opportunity to embark on a trip to Asia countries to learn more about finance and entrepreneurship.
