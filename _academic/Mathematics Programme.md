<p>The design of the Mathematics curriculum at Dunman High School (DHS) is
guided by the Ministry of Education’s <em>Teaching and Learning Guide</em> and
anchored in the DHS Total Curriculum Framework.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>Curriculum</strong></h3>
<p>Mathematics plays a pivotal role in the advancement of numerous disciplines
and underpins many of today’s innovations and future solutions. It enables
us to model and understand real-world phenomena — such as consumer behaviour,
population dynamics, and disease outbreaks — and to create modern technological
solutions, including animated films, mobile applications, and autonomous
vehicles. It also enhances productivity, supports strategic decision-making,
and strengthens cybersecurity through tools such as business analytics,
academic research methodologies, and encryption technologies.</p>

<p>At DHS, in line with our mission to nurture “Role Models of Learning,
Leaders of Honour, and Pillars of Society,” we believe that Mathematics
education should empower students with the knowledge, skills, and thinking
capacities needed to thrive in the future economy and society. By developing
logical, critical, and analytical thinking, students are equipped for lifelong
success and are well-prepared to contribute to national initiatives such
as Singapore’s Smart Nation, where computational and mathematical literacy
is essential.</p>
<p>Our Mathematics curriculum is designed with these goals in mind and spans
a seamless six-year Integrated Programme (IP) for students joining us after
PSLE. For students entering DHS via the Joint Admission Exercise, the Senior
High Mathematics programme is designed to integrate them smoothly with
IP students, ensuring continuity and coherence in learning.</p>

<p>In the Junior High years, all IP students undertake <strong>Math 1 and Math 2</strong>,
which together cover and extend beyond O-Level Mathematics and Additional
Mathematics. This ensures a strong foundation for advanced study. Students
who show exceptional aptitude in Mathematics may opt to study Math 2 at
the D2 level, where they delve deeper into selected topics, challenging
themselves with enriched content and greater conceptual depth.</p>

<p>In Senior High, aligned to A level curriculum, students choose between <strong>H1 or H2 Mathematics</strong> based
on their interests and university aspirations. H1 Mathematics supports
students inclined toward pursuing business and social science disciplines,
while H2 Mathematics is more suited for those targeting science, technology,
engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. Students with a strong passion
and readiness for the subject may further opt for <strong>H2 Further Mathematics and/or MOE-H3 Mathematics</strong>,
offering them deeper exposure and preparation for higher-level studies
requiring more in-depth mathematical knowledge.</p>

<h4><strong>Enrichment and Competitions</strong></h4>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

</div>
<p>DHS students benefit from collaborations with organisations such as the
Gifted Education Branch, the Singapore Mathematical Society, and international
partners. These partnerships provide access to enrichment programmes and
competitions including the <strong>Singapore Mathematical Olympiad, American Mathematics Competition, and the Singapore Mathematical Society Project Festival</strong>,
allowing students to pursue their passion and stretch their potential.
Students also have valuable opportunities to develop practical financial
literacy skills and actively participate in engaging, real-world problem-solving
through an interactive math trail experience.</p>
<h3><strong>Delivery</strong></h3>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/JH_Math2.jpg">
</div>
<h3><strong>Readiness, Engagement, and Mastery</strong></h3>
<p>Our curriculum delivery is centred around three pillars:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Readiness</strong>: We consider students’ profiles, prior knowledge,
and learning environments to tailor differentiated experiences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Engagement</strong>: Instruction is driven by a blend of activity-based
learning, inquiry-based learning, and direct instruction. Students experience
discovery learning, open-ended problem solving, and collaborative group
work. Engaging tools such as games and real-life applications are integrated
to maintain motivation and deepen understanding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mastery</strong>: Students consolidate and extend their learning
through regular summaries, reviews, and practice. Emphasis is placed on
ensuring all students — regardless of ability — are supported to grow,
while those with a mathematical flair are challenged further to reach their
full potential.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Our Mathematics curriculum emphasises both the discipline and utility
of Mathematics. Students explore the nature and practices of Mathematics
while also applying it as a problem-solving tool in authentic contexts.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The curriculum is underpinned by the philosophy of <strong>Teaching towards Big Ideas</strong>,
guiding students to make meaningful connections across mathematical concepts
and with other disciplines. A strong focus is placed on the development
of 21st-century competencies, particularly critical and adaptive thinking,
through regular problem-solving opportunities.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/JH_Math4.jpg">
</div>
<p></p>
<p>Students also engage in <strong>Mathematical Modelling</strong>, which
involves analysing real-world problems, making assumptions, building mathematical
representations, and validating predictions — deepening their appreciation
and application of the subject.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Communication and collaboration are also key, and students are regularly
encouraged to reason and articulate their mathematical ideas confidently,
both individually and in teams, through various media.</p>
<h3><strong>Assessment&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>Assessment is an integral part of our teaching and learning process. We
adopt a balanced mix of formative and summative assessments to evaluate
learning outcomes and inform instructional strategies. Formative assessments
offer timely feedback, empowering students to track their progress and
take ownership of their learning.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/JH_Math.jpg">
</div>
<p>Not all assessments are graded, particularly formative tasks, which are
used to identify learning gaps and guide interventions. Traditional written
tests remain important, but students also undertake alternative assessments—especially
at the Junior High level—including group projects, oral presentations,
e-assessments, and authentic tasks.</p>
<p></p>
<p>All assessments are designed to be purposeful, appropriately challenging,
and aligned with learning objectives, helping to foster confidence and
sustain positive attitudes towards Mathematics.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Through intentional planning, thoughtful pedagogy, and robust support
structures, our Mathematics programme aspires to nurture confident problem-solvers,
critical thinkers, and collaborative learners — equipped to contribute
meaningfully in a rapidly evolving world.</p>
