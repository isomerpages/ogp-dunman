The Dunman High Bicultural Studies Programme (BSP) is offered by the Mother Tongue Languages and English Departments to nurture students in their bilingual competencies and bicultural disposition. Undergirded by the philosophy of ensuring strong foundations while aiming to bring out the best in our students, it supports our SAP School Culture by curating quality and multi-faceted language and cultural learning experiences to build a strong language foundation in our students and equip them with bicultural competencies to prepare them for the challenges of an increasingly complex world.

Apart from learning the compulsory subjects of Higher Chinese and English Language, all Junior High students (Year 1 to Year 4) will also have the opportunity to attend enrichment modules like the Appreciation of Chinese Culture in Year 1 & 2 and Bilingual Programme in Year 4.

In addition, the Mother Tongue Languages and English teachers collaborate to design and implement the BSP to achieve a rich and dynamic fusion of language use, translation and literary study. English Language lessons emphasise analytical and creative language and literary skills in students, while the Higher Chinese lessons, together with the Appreciation of Chinese Culture programme, develop students as active and proficient users of their Mother Tongue Language with a disposition for culture appreciation. The Bilingual Programme, with the use of materials like literature texts, is designed to equip our students with basic translation skills, and to take them to new levels of creative expression and critical analysis, while strengthening the fundamentals of formal writing and oral presentation.

Besides the Mother Tongue Languages and English programmes, the **[Conversational Malay Programme](https://dunmanhigh.moe.edu.sg/malay_subjects/)**, a unique feature of Special Assistance Plan schools, is offered to all Year 1 and Year 2 students. The **[Malay (Special Programme)](https://dunmanhigh.moe.edu.sg/malay_subjects/)** is offered to Year 1 to Year 4 students who demonstrate passion and aptitude for the Malay Language and these students go on to take the Malay Language ‘O’ level examination as a third language. The school also offers H1 Malay Language and H1 Tamil Language at “A” level for students who are required to take these subjects. Students offering H1 Tamil Language will be having lessons in another JC.
