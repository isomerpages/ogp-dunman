### **1. Bicultural Studies Programme (BSP)**

The Bicultural Studies Programme (MOE) \[BSP\] is a 4-year scholarship programme offered by MOE that spans from Year 3 (Sec 3) to Year 6 (JC 2). It aims to develop bicultural and bilingual talents who can effectively interact with China and the West and have the capacity to engage in key issues relating to contemporary China with cross-cultural perspectives.

The BSP scholarship is open for application by Year 2 students (Singapore Citizens) each year. Applicants who exhibit good character and strong academic performance may be offered the scholarship. The scholarship opportunities are also extended to the Year 5 (JC 1) students.

BSP scholars will get to enjoy an annual allowance, a waiver of school fees, participation in MOE-organised bicultural studies camp and symposium, as well as subsidies for study immersion programmes to China, ASEAN and western countries for up to 10 weeks. The immersion experience will enable students to understand more about the political and social makeup of the world superpowers, as well as their relations with Singapore and the rest of the world. During these trips, students will have the opportunities to attend lectures at the top-ranking universities, and interact with the students at the schools. The overseas immersion trips also include visits to government agencies and commercial enterprises. As part of the scholarship requirements, BSP scholars must offer _H2 China Studies in Chinese_ as one of their subjects for the GCE ‘A’ level Examinations.

Apart from the BSP scholarship programme, the school also offers the 2-Year BSP non-scholarship programme to students from Year 3 to Year 4. Students onboard the non-scholarship programme will participate in the same learning activities as the BSP scholars. However, study immersion trip opportunities are subjected to availability of vacancies and selection criteria.

The Chinese Language Elective Programme at Secondary Level (CLEP-Sec) is introduced by the Ministry of Education to be implemented from 2020. It aims to nurture promising students to attain a high level of language proficiency in Chinese, and enhance their understanding of Chinese literature.

A one to two-week overseas immersion programme will be organised towards the end of Year 3. Students will also participate in school-based activities and programmes such as literary lectures, Meet-the-Author sessions, enrichment workshops, project work competition etc.

Outstanding Singapore Citizens selected for the CLEP-Sec will receive an annual scholarship allowance of $1,000. School fees will also be covered, subject to an annual cap of $2,400. Subsidy for overseas immersion trip will also be given. The duration of the programme is two years, from Year 3 to Year4.
