## **Conversational Malay (Year 1 & 2)**

### **Overview**

Dunman High School offers the Conversational Malay Programme to enable students to communicate with Malay-speaking peers. This compulsory programme for Year 1 and 2 students aims to develop our students’ ability to speak and understand simple Conversational Malay. They will learn basic sentence structures and vocabulary for everyday situations. By the end of the programme, our students should be able to:

*   Understand simple spoken Malay Language
*   Ask and answer questions using simple Malay Language
*   Show an awareness and appreciation of Malay Culture

The teachers in Dunman High School use various teaching strategies to engage students in their learning, such as quizzes, dialogues, role plays and presentations, as well as enrichment activities where students are given the opportunity to enhance their appreciation of Malay culture.

The focus in Y2 is on celebrations and festivals. Students’ Malay language skills will be developed through:

*   reading and conversing based on picture and dialogue
*   vocabulary and practices
