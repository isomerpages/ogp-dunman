## **1. Conversational Malay (Year 1 & 2)**

### **Overview**

Dunman High School offers the Conversational Malay Programme to enable students to communicate with Malay-speaking peers. This compulsory programme for Year 1 and 2 students aims to develop our students’ ability to speak and understand simple Conversational Malay. They will learn basic sentence structures and vocabulary for everyday situations. By the end of the programme, our students should be able to:

*   Understand simple spoken Malay Language
*   Ask and answer questions using simple Malay Language
*   Show an awareness and appreciation of Malay Culture

The teachers in Dunman High School use various teaching strategies to engage students in their learning, such as quizzes, dialogues, role plays and presentations, as well as enrichment activities where students are given the opportunity to enhance their appreciation of Malay culture.

The focus in Y2 is on celebrations and festivals. Students’ Malay language skills will be developed through:

*   reading and conversing based on picture and dialogue
*   vocabulary and practices

## **2. Malay Special Programme (Year 1 - Year 4)**

The Malay Special Programme (MSP) is offered to pupils who are interested and inclined towards learning the Malay language and culture. This third language subject is conducted in-house and is facilitated through weekly lessons and various enrichment opportunities. Through the span of four years, students offering MSP are equipped with the necessary skills to articulate and write like a native Malay student.  In recent years, Dunman High’s MSP has been organising her very own annual National Scrabble Competition _(Sahibba WOW!)_ and National MSP Essay Writing Competition (_Tari Pena_). These events have provided a highly interactive learning environment for all MSP students in Singapore to showcase their oratorical and writing skills. Apart from the academic takeaways, the MSP also aims to further enhance the understanding of the Malay culture among the students. Through our Twinning Programme with Sekolah Seri Puteri of Cyberjaya, Malaysia, students are exposed to the unique intricacies and traditions of the Malay culture as they encounter eventful experiences and interactions with native Malay speakers, further developing their cultural quotient.
