<h3><strong>Content</strong></h3>
<p>Project Work is designed to nurture essential 21st-century competencies
in our students. Through carefully structured activities and projects,
students develop their <strong>Critical, Adaptive and Inventive Thinking skills</strong>,
enabling them to analyse complex problems and generate innovative solutions.</p>
<p>The programme places strong emphasis on developing effective <strong>Communication skills</strong>,
allowing students to articulate their ideas clearly and persuasively across
various platforms. Additionally, students enhance their <strong>Collaboration skills</strong> by
working in teams, learning to manage group dynamics and leveraging on one
another's strengths.</p>
<h3><strong>Delivery</strong></h3>
<p>The programme employs two key pedagogical approaches to maximise student
learning. Through <strong>Collaborative Learning</strong>, students work
in teams to tackle their chosen real-world issues, sharing perspectives
and building on each other's ideas.</p>
<p>This approach is complemented by <strong>Inquiry-Based Learning</strong>,
which encompasses both Project-Based and Design-Based Learning approaches.
Students engage in sustained inquiry, exploring authentic problems and
developing solutions through systematic investigation and an iterative
design process.</p>
<h3><strong>Assessment&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>Assessment in Project Work consist of both Assessment for Learning (AfL)
and Assessment of Learning (AoL). Throughout the course, teachers continuously
gather evidence of students' learning and development, providing targeted
feedback to guide their progress.</p>
<p>The summative assessment comprises three key components:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Project Summary</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Individual Reflection</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oral Presentation</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These components collectively evaluate students' development of the competencies
developed throughout the programme.</p>
