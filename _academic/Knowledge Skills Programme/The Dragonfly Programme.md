<h3><strong>Content</strong></h3>
<p>At Dunman High School, our Dragonfly Programme draws inspiration from
the dragonfly that exemplifies extraordinary capabilities in the natural
world. With the aim to develop future-ready students who can navigate different
domains and perspectives effectively, the Dragonfly Programme serves to
be a starting point for students to acquire and display positive learning
dispositions and skill competencies.</p>

<h3><strong>Delivery</strong></h3>
<p>The Dragonfly Programme adopts a modular approach, spread across two years
of lower secondary education, with weekly one-hour sessions in the curriculum.
Learning experiences are structured around hands-on activities, design
sprints, and real-world problem-solving scenarios.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Students engage in interviewing stakeholders, prototyping solutions, and
creating digital applications to address genuine community needs or environmental
concerns (e.g., helping the elderly maintain independence or reducing resource
wastage in schools). Through these experiences, students develop both technical
competencies and soft skills such as empathy, communication, and collaboration.</p>

<h3><strong>Assessment&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>The Dragonfly Programme adopts a comprehensive assessment approach that
evaluates both individual and group performance. Students demonstrate their
competencies through research work, technical assignments in programming
and digital fabrication, and collaborative group projects.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Assessment is holistic, incorporating both peer and teacher evaluations
to provide a well-rounded view of student growth. Final projects culminate
in group pitches, where students present their solutions to real-world
problems, showcasing both their technical expertise and communication skills.</p>
