<p>Dunman High School offers a progressive six-year science education where
students joining us from PSLE develop skills and knowledge in a structured
and holistic way. Science education extends beyond the classroom, with
opportunities for students to engage in research, participate in national
competitions, and take on leadership roles by organising science-related
events for their juniors.</p>

<p>These experiences empower students to apply their scientific understanding
meaningfully, fostering a culture of inquiry, innovation, and collaboration.
For students entering DHS via the Joint Admission Exercise, the Senior
High Science programme is designed to integrate them smoothly with IP students,
ensuring continuity and coherence in learning.</p>
<h3><strong>Curriculum</strong></h3>

<p>Lower Secondary Science is organised around five themes, which provide
the foundational concepts that students need for the disciplinary Sciences
(Biology, Chemistry and Physics) at upper secondary.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Lower Secondary Science curriculum encompasses five themes, namely: <strong>The Scientific Endeavour, Diversity, Models, Interactions and Systems.</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>For Upper Secondary Science, students are offered to take <strong>Biology, Chemistry </strong>and<strong> Physics</strong>.
Students who show exceptional aptitude in Science may opt to study Science
subjects at the D2 level, where they delve deeper into selected topics,
challenging themselves with enriched content and greater conceptual depth.</p>

<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Aligned to the A level curriculum, students pursue Science subjects, <strong>Biology, Chemistry </strong>and <strong>Physics</strong> at
the different levels (H1, H2 or H3) depending on their interests and abilities
and are offered to take the Singapore-Cambridge General Certificate of
Education Advanced Level examinations. The study of Sciences at Senior
High builds on the foundations and knowledge acquired at Junior High/ O-level
and develops deeper understanding and application of scientific concepts
and principles at a higher level.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Beyond knowledge and skills, the Senior High Science programme aims to
develop in students the discipline, values and attitudes that will enable
them to apply their knowledge in an ethical way.</p>

<h3><strong>Content</strong></h3>
<p>Beyond the Science Programme, our school offers differentiated enrichment
to cater to diverse learning needs and interests. At the <strong>foundational level</strong>,
students explore various scientific fields through learning journeys, workshops
and Enrichment Modules in areas such as microbiology, forensic science,
and cosmetic science. Those with a strong interest in science can further
hone their investigative and problem-solving skills through mentorship
programmes and competitions, including participation in our Science Mentorship
Programme (science research) and Science Olympiads.</p>

<p></p>
<p>At the <strong>advanced level</strong>, students undertake in-depth research,
working independently or in small groups to address real-world challenges
under guidance of an expert mentor. As a culmination of their work, they
have the opportunity to present their findings at national science fairs
such as the Singapore Science and Engineering Fair and the Youth Science
Conference.</p>

<h3><strong>Delivery</strong></h3>
<p>The Science Department adopts a range of pedagogical approaches to foster
critical thinking and scientific literacy. An<strong> inquiry-based approach</strong> encourages
students to engage in hands-on experiments, open-ended investigations,
and real-world problem-solving.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

<p></p>
<p>For example, Year 1 students design and build models to direct sunlight
effectively into greenhouses as part of the Farming on Mars project. Year
3 Biology students plan and conduct their own investigations to explore
enzyme activity under varying conditions. Through structured inquiry, students
systematically develop essential science process skills — such as investigating
how temperature and concentration affect reaction rates in Chemistry, or
performing titrations to determine vitamin C content in food samples.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Beyond experimentation, students engage in case studies, article analyses,
and discussions of real-world issues — including the creation of GMOs and
controversial environmental topics — where they are encouraged to reflect
on the ethical and social implications of scientific advancements.</p>
<p></p>

<p>Technology enhances <strong>collaborative learning </strong>and<strong> peer critique</strong>,
allowing students to share data, review one another’s work, exchange ideas,
and refine their understanding through constructive feedback. By leveraging
technology, students develop digital literacy alongside scientific reasoning,
fostering a learning environment where collaboration and critical evaluation
are integral to scientific inquiry.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To nurture 21st Century Competencies — such as critical and adaptive thinking,
inventive problem-solving, and effective communication — students engage
in creative, hands-on projects like the Rube Goldberg and crane machine
challenges, where they apply scientific concepts to solve complex problems.
They also participate in performance tasks such as presentations and debates,
which further strengthen their ability to communicate and reason scientifically.</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p>These approaches, often applied in STEM-related contexts, ensure that
students not only acquire scientific knowledge, but also cultivate the
skills and mindset needed to thrive in a rapidly evolving world.</p>
<h3><strong>Assessment&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>Assessment complements teaching and learning by providing timely and accurate
insights into students’ understanding of concepts, mastery of skills, and
overall learning progress — for both teachers and students.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/sci_lab5.png">
</div>
<p>Beyond written tests and assignments, students demonstrate their learning
through authentic performance tasks that mirror real-world applications.
These include planning and conducting laboratory investigations, as well
as designing models or prototypes to communicate scientific concepts and
address both scientific and practical challenges.</p>
<p></p>

<p>Technology is seamlessly integrated into assessment practices enabling
students to complete online quizzes and present their projects digitally.
In addition, students are encouraged to reflect on their growth in both
disciplinary and affective domains over time. They engage in self-evaluation
and benefit from constructive peer feedback, fostering a deeper awareness
of their learning journey.</p>
