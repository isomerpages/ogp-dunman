<p>Dunman High School offers a progressive six-year science education where
students joining us from PSLE develop skills and knowledge in a structured
and holistic way. Science education extends beyond the classroom, with
opportunities for students to engage in research, participate in national
competitions, and take on leadership roles by organising science-related
events for their juniors.</p>
<p></p>
<p>These experiences empower students to apply their scientific understanding
meaningfully, fostering a culture of inquiry, innovation, and collaboration.
For students entering DHS via the Joint Admission Exercise, the Senior
High Science programme is designed to integrate them smoothly with IP students,
ensuring continuity and coherence in learning.</p>

<p>In line with Dunman High School’s vision to nurture “Role Models of Learning,
Leaders of Honour, and Pillars of Society”, the Science Programme aims
to cultivate all Dunmanians with a scientific mind and attitude, enabling
them to be adept citizens who care for the environment and contribute effectively
in a technologically-driven world.</p>

<h3><strong>Curriculum</strong></h3>
<p>The DHS Science Programme enables students to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>develop an interest in matters of scientific importance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop skills and attitudes in the study and practice of science (Demonstrating
Ways of Thinking &amp; Doing in Science)&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>be able to recognise the usefulness and limitations of scientific methods
(Understanding the Nature of Scientific knowledge)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>appreciate scientific applications in various disciplines and in everyday
life (Relating Science, Technology, Society &amp; Environment)&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop 21st Century Competencies, with focus on Critical Thinking, Adaptive
Thinking, Inventive Thinking, Communication and Civic Literacy&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Content</strong></h3>
<p>Beyond the Science Programme, our school offers differentiated enrichment
to cater to diverse learning needs and interests. At the <strong>foundational level</strong>,
students explore various scientific fields through learning journeys, workshops
and Enrichment Modules in areas such as microbiology, forensic science,
and cosmetic science. Those with a strong interest in science can further
hone their investigative and problem-solving skills through mentorship
programmes and competitions, including participation in our Science Mentorship
Programme (science research) and Science Olympiads.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At the <strong>advanced level</strong>, students undertake in-depth research,
working independently or in small groups to address real-world challenges
under guidance of an expert mentor. As a culmination of their work, they
have the opportunity to present their findings at national science fairs
such as the Singapore Science and Engineering Fair and the Youth Science
Conference.</p>
<h3><strong>Delivery</strong></h3>
<p>At DHS, Humanities programmes are delivered through a dynamic, inquiry-based,
and student-centred approach. Lessons are intentionally designed to be
interactive, authentic, and reflective, enabling students to take ownership
of their learning and actively construct knowledge.</p>
<p></p>

<p>Across subjects, lesson delivery incorporates a variety of strategies
such as role-play, debates, group discussions and projects. These approaches
are complemented by experiential learning opportunities like fieldwork,
learning journeys, and investigative tasks that connect academic content
to real-world contexts. Digital platforms enhance engagement, allowing
students to analyse data, explore diverse perspectives, and construct knowledge
by forming evidence-based conclusions.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Across all subjects, lesson delivery emphasises reflection, independence,
and collaboration—equipping students to be thoughtful inquirers, engaged
citizens, and adaptable, future-ready learners. Humanities lessons at DHS
are crafted not just to impart knowledge, but to nurture reflective inquirers,
engaged citizens, and future-ready learners prepared to navigate and contribute
meaningfully to a complex, interconnected world.</p>

<h3><strong>Assessment&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>At the heart of our assessment philosophy is the belief that assessment
should inspire growth, reflection, and a lifelong love for learning. Through
the intentional design of assessments, we aim for students to develop core
skills such as critical thinking and communication, and sustain their curiosity,
build independence, and deepen their appreciation of the world.</p>

</div>
<p></p>
<p>To support this, we employ a variety of authentic and reflective assessment
strategies such as fieldwork, reflecting on diverse perspectives and communicating
these insights through a multitude of media such as forum letters, videos,
podcasts, infographics, reports and essays. Our assessments support continuous
learning and development through class practices, quizzes, peer and self-assessments,
and sample marking. Students receive timely feedback that informs their
learning and encourages ownership of their academic growth. These practices
encourage metacognition, helping students monitor their own thinking and
continuously improve their learning.</p>
