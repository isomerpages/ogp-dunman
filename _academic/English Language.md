<h3><strong>Curriculum 课程内容</strong></h3>
<p>The English Programme comprises a range of curricula that aim to develop
in Dunmanians critical and creative thinking alongside essential language
and communication skills. Capitalising on the 6 years of education our
students have with us, we offer a spiral curriculum so that the students
can build on the skills and content they have learnt previously.</p>
<p>At Junior High, the English Department offers a comprehensive programme
which enlivens the learning of the English Language through integrating
aspects of linguistics, literature, media studies and social studies. Students
who have a passion for Literature offer Literature in English in Years
3 and 4. At Senior High, students are further challenged to think critically
about current affairs and issues of global and local significance in the
study of General Paper through in-depth analysis and evaluation of wide-ranging
topics. ‘A’ Level Literature in English, and English Language and Linguistics
allow students to explore more closely the intricacies of the English Language
so as to heighten their sensitivity to the contextual use of the language.</p>
<p>The following subjects are offered by the English Department:</p>

<h3><strong>Pedagogy 教学法</strong></h3>
<p>In Dunman High, the teachers in the English Department infuse a variety
of teaching pedagogies into the curriculum, allowing students to learn
and acquire critical thinking skills through various platforms. In order
to enhance our students’ ability to fluently and effectively in Standard
English, we provide them with opportunities to understand how language
changes according to purpose, audience, context and culture, and apply
this knowledge in speech and writing in both formal and informal situations.</p>
<p>英文部门的老师在教学中融入各种教学法，通过多种平台让学生学习并运用批判性思维技能。为了促进学生流利及有效使用标准英语，我们会为学生提供各种机会，以让他们了解语文如何因目的、对象、语境及文化而改变，并在正式和非正式的场合进行演讲和写作活动。</p>
<p>The English Programme is generally based on the Understanding by Design
(UbD) framework, a planning process and structure to guide curriculum,
instruction and assessment, developed by Grant Wiggins and Jay McTighe.
Students are encouraged to make meaning of ‘big ideas’ and transfer their
learning to new and different contexts. Lessons are designed to provide
numerous opportunities for students to explain, interpret, apply, shift
perspective, empathise and self-assess when interacting with a variety
of texts, both print and non-print.</p>
<p>Guided by the UbD framework, teachers employ a diverse range of methodologies
to cater to the different learning needs of our students. One such strategy
is Literary Circles where small groups of students gather to discuss a
given text (print or non-print) in depth. Literary Circles allow students
to engage in critical thinking and reflection as they read, respond to
and discuss the texts, and they gain a deeper understanding of the text
through structured discussions and extended written and artistic responses.
In addition to the teacher’s facilitation and guidance via the use of essential
questions, the students’ responses are also enriched by their peers’ insights
and questions.</p>
<p>Socratic Questioning and Socratic Seminars are commonly used in lessons
to develop critical thinking among students. Through Socratic Questioning,
a system of disciplined questioning, students, especially at the upper
levels, are invited to explore complex ideas, analyse issues and problems,
and uncover assumptions. In Socratic Seminars, students engage in a rigorous
and thoughtful dialogue to gain a deeper understanding of complex ideas
in different texts. These also encourage students to engage in meta-cognitive
thinking and help them to develop a personal voice.</p>
<p>Teachers also use Richard Paul’s Wheel of Reasoning to guide students
in their thought process and reasoning in a logical manner. Through eight
different elements of productive thinking, students learn to consider questions,
issues and perspectives carefully and meaningfully. Students will practise
making inferences, weighing evidence, recognising different points of views,
and other forms of logical reasoning as they work through the given task
– skills that are crucial in the different subjects under the English Department.</p>
<p>To emphasise the relevance of the various English subjects, teachers endeavour
to use authentic material in the lessons. Through authentic texts such
as speeches, advertisements and newspapers articles, students not only
become more sensitised to the subtle nuances of language use, they also
appreciate better the relevance of English Language to their lives. At
the upper levels, lessons focus more on current affairs and this helps
them to become more informed of the issues that face Singapore and the
world, and broaden their global outlook.</p>
<p>英文的课程、教学以及评估以重理解的课程设计为理念和框架。课程鼓励学生诠释主题，并举一反三，应用所学。课堂提供许多机会，让学生在接触各种文体时理解文本、领悟内容、运用所学、学习改变观点、运用同理心以及自我评估。</p>
<p>在重理解的课程设计框架中，老师运用多种教学法来配合学生不同的学习需求。其中一种教学方式，就是让学生组成阅读分享小组，通过小组讨论深入探讨文献。阅读分享小组让学生在阅读、赏析和讨论文献时进行批判性思考及反思。学生也通过有组织的讨论和各种表述对文献有更深一层的理解。老师通过提出有针对性的问题作为引导，学生也能从其他同学的意见与提问中获益。</p>
<p>课堂上常使用苏格拉底提问法和苏格拉底研讨会来培养学生批判性思考的能力。通过具系统性的苏格拉底提问法，高年级学生能够更好地探讨较复杂的主题，分析各种课题与文体，以及提出更多假设。学生通过苏格拉底研讨会进行深具启发性的对话，以便更深入了解不同文本的要点。这也能鼓励学生思考自己的想法，帮助他们形成自己的意见。</p>
<p>老师也使用保罗思维模式来引导学生进行逻辑性思考。通过有效思考的八个元素，学生学会仔细和有意义地思考问题、课题及观点。通过活动，学生也练习提出推论、评估答案、辨识不同角度的观点以及其他逻辑理论等技能，而这些技能是各个英文学科的主要技能。</p>
<p>为了强调英文各科目的实用性，老师们尽可能选用最真实的教材。通过演讲辞、广告以及新闻篇章，学生不但能提升语感，也能更好地体会英文在生活中的实用性。高年级的课堂主要着重于时事新闻，以帮助学生了解新加坡及全球所面对的问题，以拓展学生的视野。</p>
<h3><strong>Assessment&nbsp;评估与测试</strong></h3>
<p>In Dunman High, we employ a variety of methods to assess the English language
skills of the students. These skills encompass reading, writing, speaking,
listening and visual literacy. We also place an emphasis on multimodal
texts to align with current trends and reading habits of the young today.
A high premium is placed on crafting effective methods of assessment, as
this is an important complement to a rigorous language curriculum. The
observations made from assessing our students then enable our teachers
to refine and adapt the pedagogy to better cater to our students’ learning
needs.</p>
<p>通过进行形成性及总结性评估等各种评估方式，评估学生使用语文的能力，以及对教材内容的了解。由于评估是教学的核心部分，其主要目的是在于帮助学生学习，因此老师们通过学生在各种练习中的表现来调整教学方式，以应付学生的需求。</p>
<p>Assessment tasks as part of formative assessment are carried out regularly
so that teachers are able to give students timely customised feedback and
guidance that they could work on in order to improve. At the lower secondary
level, process writing is used to allow students to become accustomed to
good writing practices. Other formative assessment tasks include reflections
and journals, role-plays, research projects and oral presentations, where
students apply the language skills and content that they have learnt. Teachers
also provide opportunities for students to work in groups to enhance their
communication and collaboration skills.</p>
<p>Summative assessment emphasises knowledge acquisition and reproduction
in a time-trial environment. At Junior High, students are assessed on their
listening, speaking, viewing and writing skills and content during the
Common Tests and End-of-Year Examinations. At Senior High, the Common Test,
the Mid-Year Examinations, the Promotional and the Preliminary Examinations
are aligned to the structure and requirements of the ‘A’ Level Examinations
in order to ensure that students have the requisite skills and content.</p>
<p>形成性评估之一 — 平日作业，能够及时给予学生反馈与指导，帮助学生改进。初中阶段，学生通过有步骤地写作，以形成良好的写作方式。其他形成性评估包括自我反思、日记、角色扮演、专题作业和口头呈现，都是学生运用所学习的语文技能和知识的方式。老师也提供机会，让学生通过小组活动来加强他们的表达与协作能力。</p>
<p>总结性评估考核学生对知识的掌握程度。初中阶段，学校通过统一测验及年终考试来评估学生的听、说、读、写的技巧及课程内容。到了高中，统一测验、年中考试、年终考试、毕业考试都以“A”水准考试的架构和要求为准，以确保学生已掌握相关的技能和课程内容。</p>
