<p>The Aesthetics Department seeks to nurture students with the ability to
appreciate the aesthetics and the skills to participate in the creative
process of arts-making. It reaches out to the entire cohort of lower secondary
students through the Art, Music and Life Skills Programme (LSP) curriculum.</p>
<h2><strong>Curriculum</strong></h2>
<p>For the more artistically or musically-inclined students, the Aesthetics
Department provides opportunities to develop their skills and widen their
exposure to a broad range of genres and repertoire through the Music Elective
Programme (JH) and Art Special Programme at Junior High, and the Music
Elective Programme (SH) and H2 Art at Senior High.</p>

<h4><strong>Art &amp; Art Special Programme (ASP)</strong></h4>
<p></p>

<p>Through Art, students are involved in the three behavioural domains of
seeing, expressing and appreciating, which take into consideration the
cognitive, affective and psychomotor dimensions of art-making. The framework
ensures that students are provided with opportunities to observe their
environment, generate ideas, create artworks, discuss about art and value
the role of art in society.</p>
<p></p>

<p>The Art Special Programme (ASP) is a platform for students who are committed
and passionate about Art to further their Art education beyond the compulsory
Art subject. Taken as an examinable subject in Years 1-4, it provides students
with deeper understanding of various art elements and design principles,
and possibilities to explore a wider range of media and techniques. ASP
students are also given opportunities to visit museums and platforms to
showcase their talents through exhibitions.</p>
<h4><strong>H2 Art</strong></h4>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

</div>
<p>H2 Art offers students a comprehensive curriculum in art with a balance
of art making and discourse learning experiences. Through the study of
art, students develop fresh perspectives, an embodied understanding of
art and its connection to the real world. It is a valuable course of study
for students who are looking to complement their studies in other disciplines.
By developing students’ visual literacy, critical faculties, and dispositions
to engage in sustained practice as active artists and informed audience,
H2 Art prepares students for a range of arts-related and humanities courses
at university levels.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Music &amp; Music Elective Programme (MEP)</strong></h4>
<p>In Music, the musical skills of listening, creating and performing are
taught in an integrative manner. Through active musical experiences, students
learn about the elements of music and apply these concepts in music-making.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Y5_Indian_Music_Workshop.jpg">
</div>
<p></p>
<p>The MEP curriculum aims to develop students' musical perception, broaden
their knowledge of music from a wide range of genres and culture, and provides
opportunities for creating and performing music, both individually and
in groups. Learning takes place both in and out of the classrooms, through
listening, performing, composing, as well as enrichment activities such
as concerts, camps, masterclasses, workshops and competitions.</p>
<h4><strong>Life Skills Programme</strong></h4>
<p>The LSP seeks to provide students with the knowledge and skills for better
understanding of the application of food nutrition and textiles. It inculcates
positive attitudes that will empower students to make informed choices
regarding food and nutrition in their daily lives. In the process, it empowers
students to take responsibility in making choices and decisions about their
health and daily needs.</p>
<h3><strong>Delivery</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Development of Emerging 21st Century Competencies</strong></h4>
<p>Art and Music subjects are natural platforms for the development of 21st
Century Competencies such as Inventive Thinking, Critical Thinking and
Communication. Learning Art and Music requires understanding of abstract
concepts and applying this understanding in analysing and describing a
piece of artwork or music. To further sharpen their understanding, students
are also required to compare pieces of works and highlight their differences.
They need to be able to use appropriate technical vocabulary which demonstrates
their understanding of the various concepts.</p>
<p>During the process of making artworks and music compositions, students
explore various ideas and experiment with different techniques to express
their thoughts and ideas. They also reflect on their progress and find
solutions for the challenges they face along the way. This process develops
critical and creative thinking, and allows for self-expression and collaboration.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Experiential Learning</strong></h4>
<p>We believe that students learn best when they participate in activities
that involve active hands-on experiences like art and music-making. Through
these experiences, students are better able to appreciate the relevant
style and the artistic elements that work together to bring about the style.
Hence, we strive to connect the teaching of theory with practical activities,
which also bring about greater engagement, collaboration and development
of artistic or musical skills.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Collaborative Learning</strong></h4>
<p>We believe in providing a safe and friendly environment for learning and
creativity to take place spontaneously. When students collaborate in a
small groups, they engage in problem solving or creative activities in
a less threatening environment. Individual students’ voices are heard as
they engage in exchange of ideas and views. Peer-learning takes place informally,
leading to an enriched experience for all.</p>
<h3><strong>Assessment&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>Assessment for Learning provides useful and timely feedback on teachers’
instructions and students’ learning. This can be in the form of students’
assignment, class presentation, exit tickets and other forms of check during
lesson time.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Weighted Assessment can be considered as Assessment for Learning when
data collected during the assessment is used for improvement of future
lessons. Students are also encouraged to learn from the assessment and
clarify their misconceptions, thereby leading to greater learning.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Assessment Methods</strong></h4>
<p>Assessment of Learning is where the results determine the placement of
a student after the assessment.</p>
<p>Some of the common assessment methods apart from pen-and-paper assessment:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Coursework: This can be a musical composition or a visual art-work which
takes anytime from a few weeks to a few months to complete. During the
process, students go through stages of idea generation, conceptualisation,
experimentation and development of actual work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Solo and Ensemble Performance, with <em>Viva Voce</em> or Reflection Notes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Portfolio Assessment: Assessment is based on students’ portfolio. Teacher’s
guidance is provided throughout in various modules.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Listening Test with or without music notation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
