### **Curriculum 课程内容**
In line with the Dunman High School’s vision “The premier school of Leaders of Honour”, the science programme aims to prepare all Dunmanians to have the presence of scientific mind and attitude that will enable them to be an adept citizen who cares for the environment and to have the technical knowledge and skills to function and contribute effectively to an increasingly technologically driven world.

为配合我校培育“堂正君子 社稷栋梁 ”的愿景，我校的科学课程旨在培养学生的科学思维和态度，从而使他们成为关心环境，且拥有相关知识和技能的公民，以助于他们在日益以科技为主导的世界里有效地工作和做出贡献。

**Science Curriculum Framework**

The Science curriculum framework was derived from Ministry of Education’s Policy Framework for the teaching and learning of Science which seeks to inculcate and nurture the spirit of inquiry and curiosity. The curriculum is delivered in the three domains – knowledge, understanding and application; skills and processes; ethics and attitudes – which support the curriculum framework. The programme strives to provide students with learning experiences which allow them to apply knowledge and draw relationships within various concepts in science, through written assignments or laboratory practical sessions, and science research work. To connect students with applications of science in their complete performance tasks collaboratively, participate in learning journeys to broaden their horizons and conduct investigate experiments to enhance their learning and appreciation of science. In particular, the school also emphasizes the inculcation of social, emotional values and sense of national responsibility. There are opportunities in every scientific topic to address the affective domain in accordance with the school learning outcomes, such as showing sensitivity, compassion, being reflective, able to learn independently and  work collaboratively, and ability to articulate views. In addition, the framework aims to establish relevance and relationship, via Science in Daily Life, Science in Society, and Science in the Environment.

**Objectives of the Science programme**

The Science Programme aims to enable students to

*   develop the interest in matters of scientific importance
*   be able to recognise the usefulness and limitations of scientific methods
*   appreciate scientific applications in other disciplines and in one’s everyday life
*   develop abilities and skills in the study and practice of science
*   develop attitudes relevant to the study and practice of science.

**A Differentiated Curriculum**

The Science curriculum is differentiated in content, process, product and learning environment to cater to the varied and diversified needs of these students.  Students will maximise their potential in the Sciences by pursuing a challenging and differentiated curriculum which will accelerate their learning experiences and develop them into independent learners and effective team workers.

Content enrichment extends the syllabus beyond the basic syllabus in depth and breadth. It caters more to individual needs and interests. It integrates different subject areas/disciplines and affective issues so as to encourage the investigation of real-life problems. Process enrichment seeks to develop higher level thinking skills. This is achieved by providing opportunities for discovery learning and open-ended problem solving, teaching research skills for independent study, and using varied teaching strategies to cater to different learning styles. Students will consistently utilize critical and creative thinking skills to seek original solutions to real-world problems. It will also develop pupils’ understanding of the ethical and moral implications of social and scientific developments. Product differentiation encourages the presentation of what has been learnt in a variety of ways thereby providing space for creative expressions.

**Science Enrichment Modules for School-Based Gifted Education (SBGE)  
**Dunman High adopts the former Gifted Education Programme Enrichment Model to differentiate programme from the mainstream. Enrichment modules aim at providing a better quality of learning or appropriate instruction for students which cannot be fully provided for within the regular classes. The school practices the grouping of students with similar high ability, aptitude and talent in SBGE classes. Students are selected to be in the SBGE classes based on their academic performance, participation and achievement in above-level science-based programmes and competitions and teachers’ recommendation.

For Science Talent Development Programme, students are also given exposure in enrichment programmes such as E2K, Eureka, research programmes from Year 2 onwards, and competitions such as Junior Olympiad. For STEM program at Lower Secondary Science, students are introduced to the Arduino Uno microcontroller and breadboarding of electrical circuits. Through a blended learning approach (online and class based), SBGE Students who are keen to pursue STEM are also gradually exposed to more complex circuits and programming concepts.

**Curriculum Content**

Lower Secondary Science is organised through the three disciplines: Biology, Chemistry and Physics.
