<h3><strong>Curriculum</strong></h3>
<p>Today, many changing socio-economic factors make proficiency in English
and the development of 21st Century Competencies (21CC) even more necessary
for our students. Globally, the increasingly competitive international
environment calls for an even greater need for linguistic and communicative
competence, adaptability and flexibility.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our programme ensures that students experience a coherent and comprehensive
language education that builds upon prior knowledge and skills. By emphasising
critical thinking, cultural awareness, and effective communication, we
prepare students to excel academically and thrive in an increasingly interconnected
world.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our comprehensive programme is designed to progressively develop critical
and creative thinking alongside essential language and communication skills,
ensuring students are well-prepared for the demands of the 21st Century
while being immersed in a variety of learning experiences.</p>
<h3><strong>Content</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Junior High English</strong></h4>
<p>Taking reference from the MOE EL Syllabus 2020, we seek to develop students
as <strong>empathetic communicators, discerning readers, and creative inquirers</strong>.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/JH_EL_table1.png">
</div>
<p></p>
<p>At Dunman High School, our English programme is designed with these key
competencies in mind. Through oral presentations, engaging discussions,
Socratic seminars and analysis of multi-modal texts, we aim to equip our
students with the emerging 21st Century competencies of Critical, Adaptive
and Inventive Thinking, Communication, Collaboration and Information Skills
and Civic, Global and Cross-Cultural Literacy.</p>
<h4><strong>Literature in English</strong></h4>
<p>Literature in English is offered to all students at the lower secondary
level. The study of Literature raises awareness of the range of perspectives
that human beings - separated by time, space and culture - are capable
of developing. This increased awareness promotes empathy and global awareness.
Students become cognisant of and reassess their own values, beliefs and
biases through the study of poetry, prose and plays.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Aligned to MOE’s Literature in English syllabus, our department also strive
to develop Dunmanians into <strong>Empathetic and Global Thinkers, Critical Readers, Creative Meaning-makers, and Convincing Communicators</strong>.</p>
<p></p>

</div>
<p>The habit of close reading promotes deep and heightened sensitivity towards
language, helping students to appreciate the nuances and layers of meaning
in texts around them. Students develop metacognitive habits of mind as
they constantly pay attention to the impact of language on thoughts and
feelings, and are sensitive to the places in a text that call for deeper
reflection and processing. Their minds are trained to acknowledge and consider
multiple perspectives, even as they learn to convince others of their interpretations.
At the same time, students develop a greater acceptance for ambiguity and
open-endedness.
<br>
</p>
<p>In Years 3 and 4, students with a passion of Literature may opt to study
it at a higher level as one of their Humanities subject. Literature at
upper secondary aims to fosters students’ appreciation for the richness
and diversity of literary texts. Through the exploration of themes, characters,
and contexts, students develop empathy, cultural awareness, and a deeper
understanding of the human condition. Deeper engagement with texts also
cultivates critical and creative thinking, as students analyze a broader
range of texts and articulate their interpretations effectively. These
skills empower them to become thoughtful and articulate individuals who
are prepared to navigate and contribute meaningfully to the world around
them.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Senior High English</strong></h4>
<p>At the A-level, General Paper (GP), English Language and Linguistics (ELL),
and Literature in English cultivate intellectual curiosity, ethical awareness,
and expressive confidence – core to the Desired Outcomes of Education and
21CC. GP develops critical thinking, ethical reasoning, and persuasive
expression through engagement with global and societal issues. ELL deepens
students’ understanding of language in real-world contexts, fostering precision
in analysis and sensitivity to linguistic diversity and change. Literature
nurtures empathy and insight through the exploration of human experiences
and worldviews. Together, these subjects prepare students to think critically,
appreciate diverse perspectives, and navigate a complex world with clarity
and confidence.</p>

<h4><strong>H3 Literature in English</strong></h4>
<p>This option is designed for students with exceptional ability and passion
for Literature. It encourages deeper specialisation and advanced literary
study.</p>
<h3><strong>Delivery</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Junior High English</strong></h4>
<p>In Dunman High, the teachers in the English Department infuse a variety
of teaching pedagogies into the curriculum, allowing students to learn
and acquire critical thinking skills through various platforms. In order
to enhance our students’ ability to fluently and effectively in Standard
English, we provide them with opportunities to understand how language
changes according to purpose, audience, context and culture, and apply
this knowledge in speech and writing in both formal and informal situations.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Guided by the EL Syllabus three foci of <strong>multiliteracies, metacognition and inquiry</strong> through
dialogue, students engage with authentic texts, group discussions, close
reading and analysis, presentations, and Socratic seminars to develop and
enhance their receptive and productive language skills. Teachers also use <strong>Richard Paul’s Wheel of Reasoning</strong> to
guide students in their thought process and reasoning in a logical manner.
Through eight different elements of productive thinking, students learn
to consider questions, issues and perspectives carefully and meaningfully.
Students will practise making inferences, weighing evidence, recognising
different points of views, and other forms of logical reasoning as they
work through the given tasks. These learning experiences allow students
to consider questions, issues and perspectives carefully and meaningfully.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At Upper Secondary levels, there is also an emphasis on civic and global
awareness. Students are invited to explore complex ideas, analyse issues
and problems, and uncover assumptions. In Socratic Seminars, students engage
in a rigorous and thoughtful dialogue to gain a deeper understanding of
complex ideas in different texts. These also encourage students to engage
in meta-cognitive thinking and help them to develop a personal voice that
is required for Senior High.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Literature in English</strong></h4>
<p>At Dunman High School, the study of <strong>Literature</strong> in English
is an immersive and dynamic experience that nurtures critical thinking,
creativity, and empathy. Through role play, students step into the shoes
of literary characters, deepening their understanding of different perspectives
and emotions. They are exposed to a diverse range of genres and texts,
from local, Asian, canonic texts to poetry and drama, broadening their
appreciation of storytelling across cultures and time periods. Exposure
to film further enrich their learning, allowing them to analyze adaptations
and visual storytelling techniques.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Research projects and creative assignments, such as scriptwriting, storytelling,
set and diorama design and multimedia presentations, encourage students
to engage deeply with texts and express their interpretations in innovative
ways. By fostering a love for literature and honing analytical skills,
our programme equips students with the ability to think critically, communicate
effectively, and appreciate the power of language in shaping the world.</p>

<h4><strong>H1 General Paper (GP)</strong></h4>
<p>In DHS, we believe that <em>GP is Life</em>. The values, skills and dispositions
that students develop in the course of studying GP are integral and closely
intertwined with what they will need to progress and thrive in life.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The teaching and learning of GP in DHS is student-centred, systematic
and organised. Through our lecture and tutorial system, students learn
through explicit instruction of skills, suitable instructional scaffolds
and regular practice with timely feedback. Students are also guided to
monitor and regulate their own learning with the help of ICT tools.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The GP classroom is a space where knowledge is actively negotiated and
co-constructed through purposeful dialogue with teachers and peers. Students
also enhance their thinking through intentional collaborative learning
experiences. They benefit from the exposure to various issues and different
perspectives. Learning activities such as learning journeys and guest lectures
add depth and diversity to their GP experience.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>H2 English Language and Linguistics (ELL)</strong></h4>
<p>In the ELL classroom, students learn linguistic concepts and tools through
explicit instruction, and apply these to analysis of texts. Appropriate
instructional scaffolds are provided, such as modelling of text analysis
and ‘live’ marking. ICT tools are strategically used to help students monitor,
review and consolidate their learning.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Through collaborative learning experiences which include class discussions
and peer feedback on tasks, students learn to communicate more effectively
and develop a stronger awareness of social conventions and contexts. Learning
journeys and inter-school ELL activities also enhance the ELL learning
experience.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As the study of ELL involves analysing texts we encounter in our daily
lives, students are involved in the curation of authentic texts so that
their learning is situated in and relevant to real-world contexts. This
aligns with our <em>GP is Life</em> philosophy, and students learn how our
thoughts and actions shape and are shaped by our society and the world.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>H2 Literature in English</strong></h4>
<p>Literature is more than the study of texts—it is the study of life. Through
deep reflection, students confront human complexities, gaining empathy
and fresh perspectives. They see how language shapes meaning, how stories
define identities, and how diverse voices—including those from Singapore—offer
windows and mirrors to the world.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Blending traditional and digital methods, we create spaces for inquiry,
collaboration, and expression. Learning journeys, multimedia resources,
and discussions immerse students in a process where they connect ideas,
communicate effectively, and solve problems with insight. Literature and
English nurture adaptable, reflective individuals—reinforcing our <em>GP is Life</em> philosophy,
where words shape thought, and thought shapes the world.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In understanding stories, they find the courage to shape their own—and
the world around them.</p>
<h3><strong>Assessment&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>Both formative and summative assessment play critical roles in providing
learner-centred and balanced assessment. Assessment tasks as part of formative
assessment are carried out regularly so that teachers are able to give
students timely customised feedback and guidance that they could work on
in order to improve.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In Dunman High, we employ a variety of methods to assess the skills of
the students required for our subjects. These skills encompass reading,
writing, speaking, listening and visual literacy. We also place an emphasis
on multimodal texts to align with current trends and reading habits of
the young today. A high premium is placed on crafting effective methods
of assessment, as this is an important complement to a rigorous language
curriculum. The observations made from assessing our students then enable
our teachers to refine and adapt the pedagogy to better cater to our students’
learning needs.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At Junior High, process writing is used to allow students to become accustomed
to good writing practices. Other formative assessment tasks include reflections
and journals, role-plays, research projects and oral presentations, where
students apply the language skills and content that they have learnt. Teachers
also provide opportunities for students to work in groups to enhance their
communication and collaboration skills, giving them a chance to produce
and receive peer feedback, and reflect on their own work.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At Senior High, Formative assessment is carried out regularly at different
points in the term to assess students’ understanding and demonstration
of skills in relation to set learning goals. Students are assessed on selected
components in different ways. This assessment informs teaching and learning
practices and helps to close the gaps between students’ current performance
and their goals.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Summative assessment is conducted during the end-of-year examinations
and at the A-levels. Summative assessment at the end of the year will focus
on written skills, allowing students to demonstrate the skills that they
have acquired over the year. The components tested include grammar editing,
situational writing, essays, reading comprehension, analysis of visual
texts, and personal responses to texts. These assessment modes will ensure
that students are able to showcase their proficiency in various aspects
of the English language, including clarity of expression, coherence in
argumentation, and depth of analysis.</p>
<p></p>
<p>By incorporating a balanced mix of assessments, our approach ensures that
students not only excel in written examinations but also gain confidence
in articulating their ideas effectively, preparing them for future academic
and real-world communication challenges.</p>
