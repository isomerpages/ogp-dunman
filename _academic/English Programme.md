<p>The English Language Department at Dunman High School is dedicated to
nurturing students who are proficient and confident users of the English
language, in alignment with the objectives of Singapore's Ministry of Education
(MOE) English Language Syllabus 2020. Our comprehensive four-year programme
is designed to progressively develop critical and creative thinking alongside
essential language and communication skills, ensuring students are well-prepared
for the demands of the 21st Century while being immersed in a variety of
learning experiences.</p>

<h3><strong>Curriculum</strong></h3>
<p>Today, many changing socio-economic factors make proficiency in English
and the development of 21st Century competencies even more necessary for
our students. Globally, the increasingly competitive international environment
calls for an even greater need for linguistic and communicative competence,
adaptability and flexibility. Our programme ensures that students experience
a coherent and comprehensive language education that builds upon prior
knowledge and skills. By emphasizing critical thinking, cultural awareness,
and effective communication, we prepare students to excel academically
and thrive in an increasingly interconnected world.</p>
<h3><strong>Content</strong></h3>
<p>Taking reference from the MOE EL Syllabus 2020, we seek to develop students
as <strong>empathetic communicators, discerning readers, and creative inquirers</strong>.</p>

<h4><strong>English Language</strong></h4>
<p>At Dunman High School, our English programme is designed with these key
competencies in mind. Through oral presentations, engaging discussions,
Socratic seminars and analysis of multi-modal texts, we aim to equip our
students with the emerging 21st Century competencies of Critical, Adaptive
and Inventive Thinking, Communication, Collaboration and Information Skills
and Civic, Global and Cross-Cultural Literacy.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Literature in English</strong></h4>
<p>Literature in English is offered to all students at the lower seconday
level. The study of Literature raises awareness of the range of perspectives
that human beings - separated by time, space and culture - are capable
of developing. This increased awareness promotes empathy and global awareness.
Students become cognisant of and reassess their own values, beliefs and
biases through the study of poetry, prose and plays.</p>

<p>The habit of close reading promotes deep and heightened sensitivity towards
language, helping students to appreciate the nuances and layers of meaning
in texts around them. Students develop metacognitive habits of mind as
they constantly pay attention to the impact of language on thoughts and
feelings, and are sensitive to the places in a text that call for deeper
reflection and processing. Their minds are trained to acknowledge and consider
multiple perspectives, even as they learn to convince others of their interpretations.
At the same time, students develop a greater acceptance for ambiguity and
open-endedness.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Aligned to MOE’s Literature in English syllabus, our department also strive
to develop Dunmanians into <strong>Empathetic and Global Thinkers, Critical Readers, Creative Meaning-makers, and Convincing Communicators</strong>.
<br>
</p>
<p>In Years 3 and 4, students with a passion of Literature may opt to study
it at a higher level as one of their Humanities subject. Literature at
upper secondary aims to fosters students’ appreciation for the richness
and diversity of literary texts. Through the exploration of themes, characters,
and contexts, students develop empathy, cultural awareness, and a deeper
understanding of the human condition. Deeper engagement with texts also
cultivates critical and creative thinking, as students analyze a broader
range of texts and articulate their interpretations effectively. These
skills empower them to become thoughtful and articulate individuals who
are prepared to navigate and contribute meaningfully to the world around
them.</p>
<h3><strong>Delivery</strong></h3>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Literature in English</strong></h4>
<p>In Dunman High, the teachers in the English Department infuse a variety
of teaching pedagogies into the curriculum, allowing students to learn
and acquire critical thinking skills through various platforms. In order
to enhance our students’ ability to fluently and effectively in Standard
English, we provide them with opportunities to understand how language
changes according to purpose, audience, context and culture, and apply
this knowledge in speech and writing in both formal and informal situations.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Guided by the EL Syllabus three foci of <strong>multiliteracies, metacognition and inquiry</strong> through
dialogue, students engage with authentic texts, group discussions, close
reading and analysis, presentations, and Socratic seminars to develop and
enhance their receptive and productive language skills. Teachers also use <strong>Richard Paul’s Wheel of Reasoning</strong> to
guide students in their thought process and reasoning in a logical manner.
Through eight different elements of productive thinking, students learn
to consider questions, issues and perspectives carefully and meaningfully.
Students will practise making inferences, weighing evidence, recognising
different points of views, and other forms of logical reasoning as they
work through the given tasks. These learning experiences allow students
to consider questions, issues and perspectives carefully and meaningfully.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At Upper Secondary levels, there is also an emphasis on civic and global
awareness. Students are invited to explore complex ideas, analyse issues
and problems, and uncover assumptions. In Socratic Seminars, students engage
in a rigorous and thoughtful dialogue to gain a deeper understanding of
complex ideas in different texts. These also encourage students to engage
in meta-cognitive thinking and help them to develop a personal voice that
is required for Senior High.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Literature in English</strong></h4>
<p>At Dunman High School, the study of <strong>Literature</strong> in English
is an immersive and dynamic experience that nurtures critical thinking,
creativity, and empathy. Through role play, students step into the shoes
of literary characters, deepening their understanding of different perspectives
and emotions. They are exposed to a diverse range of genres and texts,
from local, Asian, canonic texts to poetry and drama, broadening their
appreciation of storytelling across cultures and time periods. Exposure
to film further enrich their learning, allowing them to analyze adaptations
and visual storytelling techniques.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Research projects and creative assignments, such as scriptwriting, storytelling,
set and diorama design and multimedia presentations, encourage students
to engage deeply with texts and express their interpretations in innovative
ways. By fostering a love for literature and honing analytical skills,
our programme equips students with the ability to think critically, communicate
effectively, and appreciate the power of language in shaping the world.</p>

<h3><strong>Assessment&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>In Dunman High, we employ a variety of methods to assess the English Language
and Literature skills of the students. These skills encompass reading,
writing, speaking, listening and visual literacy. We also place an emphasis
on multimodal texts to align with current trends and reading habits of
the young today. A high premium is placed on crafting effective methods
of assessment, as this is an important complement to a rigorous language
curriculum. The observations made from assessing our students then enable
our teachers to refine and adapt the pedagogy to better cater to our students’
learning needs.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Assessment tasks as part of formative assessment are carried out regularly
so that teachers are able to give students timely customised feedback and
guidance that they could work on in order to improve. At the lower secondary
level, process writing is used to allow students to become accustomed to
good writing practices. Other formative assessment tasks include reflections
and journals, role-plays, research projects and oral presentations, where
students apply the language skills and content that they have learnt. Teachers
also provide opportunities for students to work in groups to enhance their
communication and collaboration skills, giving them a chance to produce
and receive peer feedback, and reflect on their own work.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Summative assessment at the end of the year will focus on written skills,
allowing students to demonstrate the skills that they have acquired over
the year. The components tested include grammar editing, situational writing,
essays, reading comprehension, analysis of visual texts, and personal responses
to texts. These assessment modes will ensure that students are able to
showcase their proficiency in various aspects of the English language,
including clarity of expression, coherence in argumentation, and depth
of analysis.</p>
<p></p>
<p>By incorporating a balanced mix of assessments, our approach ensures that
students not only excel in written examinations but also gain confidence
in articulating their ideas effectively, preparing them for future academic
and real-world communication challenges.</p>
