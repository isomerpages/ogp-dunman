Student Development
===================

At Dunman High, we believe in providing a holistic and well-rounded education that sees our students through not just the national examinations but also their development as confident leaders with a global outlook.

This is achieved through the following:

1.  Character Development Programme
2.  Physical Education Programme
3.  Sexuality Education
4.  Co-curricular Activities

In line with our school vision of nurturing loyal citizens with a global outlook, every student is given the opportunity to take part in overseas enrichment and immersion programmes. Overseas trips organized by either curriculum or CCA groups aims to provide every Dunmanian an opportunity to interact, communicate and collaborate with peers from other countries whose views and cultures differ from them. These programmes are intended not only to further enrich studentsâ€™ educational experience but also make them versatile and develop desired attributes to thrive in different cultures and yet remain rooted to their country.
