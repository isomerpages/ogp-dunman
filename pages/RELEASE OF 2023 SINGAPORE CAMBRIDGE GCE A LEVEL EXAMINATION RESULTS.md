<p>Dear Dunmanians,</p>
<p>Warm greetings from your alma mater! The 2023 GCE A-Level Examination
results will be released on Friday, 23 February 2024.</p>
<h4><strong>Collection of Examination Results</strong></h4>
<ol start="2" data-tight="true" class="tight">

<p>Students will collect their result slips and certificates in the school
hall. They may enter the school via Gate 1 or Gate 4 from 1.30 pm and should
be seated in the school hall by <strong>2.00pm</strong>. As lessons are
on-going on that day, students collecting results should proceed directly
to the school hall and not to be in other parts of the school. The administration
briefing will start at 2.00pm sharp. For parents who are driving, they
may park at public carparks in the Kampong Arang estate.</p>

<p>Students who are unable to collect their results in person can also access
their results online via Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board’s

from 3.15pm on Friday, 23 February 2024 till 11.59pm on Thursday, 7 March
2024. Students can use their Singpass account to access SEAB’s Candidates
