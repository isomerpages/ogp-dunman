**‘Remembering Your Roots’ Wall Mural @MRL – Plaque Write-up**

Mr Sam Goi is an entrepreneur and investor who has made a name for himself as Singapore’s legendary “Popiah King”. Born in Fuqing, China, Mr Goi came to Singapore with his mother at a young age. During his secondary school years, he studied in Dunman High School. From humble beginnings, he has navigated numerous ups and downs of the business world, overcoming obstacles with steadfast determination. Mr Goi started out in the food industry, and his business empire has since expanded into healthcare, water treatment, technology, logistics and education. He also serves as the Non-Resident Ambassador to Brazil. Over the years, he has contributed actively to the development of Singapore as he firmly believes in giving back to society. In all his endeavours, he has never forgotten his original aspirations and remains rooted to his core values.  To provide Dunmanians with well-equipped facilities, he made a generous donation for the construction of this library, which he named in memory of his mother, Yu Ik Ngok. This reflects his sincere gratitude towards his mother for his upbringing, and serves as an exemplary example for all. It is also hoped that Mr Goi’s kind and generous gesture will motivate Dunmanians to put their hearts and minds into their studies, and to contribute back to their alma mater and society in future.

Mr Sam Goi, Honorary Chairman of the School Advisory Committee, came to Singapore with his mother at the age of six. Having finally achieved success after overcoming many challenges in life, he is eternally grateful to his mother for his upbringing and her inculcation of values. When Mr Goi donated generously to the building of this library in Dunman High School, he dedicated and named it the Yu Ik Ngok Library in memory of her.

This year marks the 10th anniversary of the opening of the Yu Ik Ngok Library. As a token of gratitude to Mr Goi, composer and DHS alumnus Mr Phang Kok Jun was commissioned to compose the musical piece, “A Son’s Wish”. This piece features unabashed lyricism and beauty, with much expressive moments that symbolise the love between children and their mothers. 

This piece will be performed by the Dunman High School Chinese Orchestra during the DHS65 Anniversary Celebrations which coincides with the 10th anniversary of the opening of the Yu Ik Ngok Library. It represents an ode to a mother’s great and selfless love, and the son’s everlasting respect, memory and gratitude towards his mother. 

**游英月图书馆 ── 乐曲《游子心》简介**

“慈母手中线，游子身上衣。临行密密缝，意恐迟迟归。谁言寸草心，报得三春晖。”

德明咨询委员会荣誉主席魏成辉先生6岁随母下南洋，历经坎坷，终成大业。他始终感念母亲的养育之恩和对他的谆谆教诲，在德明捐资建立的图书馆，就以他的妈妈游英月女士命名。

今年是“游英月图书馆”建立十周年纪念。学校为了感谢魏成辉主席，专门邀请作曲家、校友冯国峻先生创作了《游子心》一曲。该曲旋律抒情，优美动听，真挚感人，音乐层层推进，描述了澎湃的心潮，表达了无尽的思念。

在德明65周年校庆暨“游英月图书馆”建立10周年庆典上，该曲将由德明华乐团演奏，郑朝吉博士指挥。乐曲歌颂了母爱的伟大和无私，也表达了身为“游子”的魏成辉荣誉主席对母亲永远的敬仰、怀念和感恩。
