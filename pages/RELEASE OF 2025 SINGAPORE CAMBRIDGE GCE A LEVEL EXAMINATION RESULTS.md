<p>The 2025 GCE A-Level Examination results will be released on <strong>Friday, 27 February 2026</strong>.</p>
<h4><strong>Collection of Examination Results</strong></h4>
<p>Students will collect their result slips and certificates in the school
hall. They may enter the school via Gate 1 or Gate 4 from 1.30 pm and should
be seated in the school hall by 2.00pm. As lessons are on-going on that
day, students collecting results should proceed directly to the school
hall and not to be in other parts of the school. The administration briefing
will start at 2.00pm sharp. For parents who are driving, they may park
at public carparks in the Kampong Arang estate.</p>

their results online via the Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board’s
