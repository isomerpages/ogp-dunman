<p>The mural is located at the end of the walkway to the school hall from
Block B and comprises 4 segments: “The Kampong Days”, “Growing Up”, “Our
Dunman High” and “Facing the Future – Onward Singapore!”. Mr Clarence Ho,
an accomplished Singaporean artist, designed the mural.</p>

<p>This mural hopes to spark off a sense of curiosity about the nation’s
past and culture in Dunmanians and serve as a focal point for Dunmanians
to reflect upon and immerse themselves in the nation’s history and heritage
of diversity. Year 3 students Ng Seng Zer Keene, Tara-Jade Sim, Xie Enxi,
and Han Yiheng also wrote accompanying poems for each of the segments.
The school would like to thank Mr Sng for gracing this ceremony!</p>
