<p>Students will collect their result slips and certificates in the school
hall. They may enter the school via Gate 1 or Gate 4 from 1.30 pm and should
be seated in the school hall by <strong>2.00pm</strong>. As lessons are

For parents who are driving, they may park at public carparks in the Kampong
Arang estate.</p>
