The Singapore Police Force Scholarship Award Ceremony was held virtually on 20 August 2020. The ceremony was graced by Mr K Shanmugam, Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Law. Our graduate, Sim Zheng Hao from Class of 2017, was awarded the Singapore Police Force Scholarship (SPFS).

The SPFS is one of the most prestigious scholarships awarded by the Public Service Commission. He will undergo training at the SPF Training Command upon completion of his studies. Subsequently, he will be posted to the Police divisions to assume investigation and command appointments. Zheng Hao will be reading Liberal Studies at New York University.

Zheng Hao shared with us his thoughts on his award and an encouragement for his juniors.  
“I am very honoured to be awarded the Singapore Police Force Scholarship to study Liberal Studies at New York University. A career with the Singapore Police Force has been my lifelong dream. COVID-19 has ultimately revealed the importance of flexibility and empathy and this is what I hope to eventually bring to the Police Force and public service. I am immensely grateful for Dunman High School – the school provided students with opportunities to serve and lead, and the teachers imparted valuable lessons that shaped me into who I am today. To my juniors, I hope that in a crazy year where we’ve all had to adapt the way we live and learn, you have found time to consider what you want to do in future! Be resilient in the face of difficulties and always be yourself. All the best!”

Congratulations to Zheng Hao once again, and his family and teachers who have played a role in guiding and developing him throughout these years.
