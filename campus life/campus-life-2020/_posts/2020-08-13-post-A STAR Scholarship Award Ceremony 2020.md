The A\*STAR Scholarship Award Ceremony was held virtually on 6 August 2020, graced by Mr Chan Chun Sing, Minister for Trade and Industry. We would like to extend our sincere congratulations to Oh Xi Yu, from Class of 2014 who was awarded the A\*STAR International Fellowship for the A\*STAR-University of Warwick Engineering Doctorate Programme.

Xi Yu shared with us how she felt about her award and offered some words of encouragement for her juniors.

“I am grateful for this scholarship, as it is both a blessing and privilege to be funded for my studies. I will be taking my Engineering Doctorate (EngD) in the University of Warwick, conducting research related to machine learning applications in the robotics and manufacturing industries.

I aspire to become a scientist who contributes to the digitalisation of Singapore’s robotics applications. I believe in the importance of research to bring about meaningful change, so I hope that my research will integrate machine learning and industrial applications more efficiently for Singapore’s technological progress.

To juniors: I used to score only S and U grades in Senior High, but as it turns out failing once (or a few times) doesn’t mean you’ll always fail. Stay resilient and know that hard work beats talent when talent fails to work hard.”
