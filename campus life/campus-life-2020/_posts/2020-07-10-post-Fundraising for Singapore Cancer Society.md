Earlier in May, Singapore Cancer Society held a virtual concert featuring five young performers to help fund-raise for the cancer community. One of them was our Year 1 student Klara Van Praet. Klara shares her experience:

“3 years ago, I lost my grandmother to cancer. It was a rare cancer that the doctors had no cure for. She could only sit on the hospital bed and rely on her own immune system. After we lost her, I wanted to help the people with cancer and hopefully they would not have to suffer like how my grandmother did.

When Singapore Cancer Society approached my mum for me and my friends to perform for the cancer patients and raise funds, I immediately said yes! This experience was unlike any other because me and my sister usually perform on stage, but due to COVID-19, we needed to record ourselves. This was special because we could not really express our emotions towards the cancer patients in person. Nonetheless, we still raised lots of money (over $120,000!). I hope that this raised amount can help the patients who cannot afford the cost of the treatment. I hope that my friends in Dunman High and those in the community could also join me in supporting cancer patients and feel the joy in helping others. I would also like to thank the Singapore Cancer Society for giving me this opportunity.”

The school is proud of Klara for her service to the community!
