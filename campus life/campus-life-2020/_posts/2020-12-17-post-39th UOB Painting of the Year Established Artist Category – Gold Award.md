“Making Sense of Difference #2”  
“和而不同#2”  
Mixed Media on Panel  
混合媒体抽象画

Write Up:  
My work braids disparate materials with different histories and stories into a harmonious whole. Working with a diversity of materials, there is expectedly a sense of clutter and conflict, with different visual qualities and meanings colliding with each other. My discordant materials and surfaces come together to continually negotiate oneness – each colour, surface, brushstroke and stain dance to build a hard-earned unity.

I achieve complexity through layering of material on top of each other, the use of various transparencies, peeling away, interweaving material and paint, wearing away and sanding down. Jarring disparities become resolved through glazing and layering translucent mulberry paper. Creases that attests to separateness fade into obscurity as the final layer of resin is poured on to the work.

I invite viewers to unveil more layers as they sit with the work, beholding the complex harmony of the various materials. This piece is a metaphor for the complexity of society and life in 2020 and aspirational about the unity of human kind today and in the days ahead. We come to the table of humanity with different languages, ethnicity, families, politics, personal histories and goals. This is especially true for Singapore and South East Asia in our diversity. Instead of being defined by difference, let us be defined by our ability to negotiate this difference into beauty, to braid diversity into solidarity.
