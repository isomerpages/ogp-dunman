The Senior High Music Elective Programme (MEP) students organised the BASH Concert on 6 March 2020, Friday, at Dunman High School’s Glass Room. This concert featured performances by the Year 5 and 6 MEP students on the piano, violin, cello, voice, clarinet, dizi and erhu, with repertoires ranging from Beethoven, Schubert, Bruch, Debussy and even Ah Bing!

In addition, this concert had a guest performance by Mrs Debbie Han (Subject Head/Music), and Ms Yick Jue Ru (Senior High MEP teacher) playing a two-piano work by Ravel. The concert also ended on a high note with two Year 6 students performing Poulenc’s exuberant Concerto for Two Pianos, featuring passages of sparkling virtuosity and haunting lament.

However, due to COVID-19 restrictions, only a limited number of Senior High students and teachers could attend the BASH concert live. The MEP students are preparing for another concert, CRASH X, which will be streamed live on 15 August 2020, allowing more audience to enjoy! Do look out for more updates.

Reflection by one student performer, Wang Zhenghao (6C37):  
While BASH 2020 had a more limited outreach and could not be carried out the same way as 2019 due to the global pandemic, we still put in our best effort to ensure that the audience were not disappointed. Playing music in front of an audience is not an unfamiliar experience for me; yet every performance feels different. I enjoy seeing the audiences’ reactions as I play, and every slight grin or nod gives me immense satisfaction. The experience playing to a live audience is very different, and I hope for future opportunities soon to have a live audience to connect with and share in the musical space together.
