Dunman High School organised its inaugural e-Careers, Scholarships and Higher Education (CSHE) Day 2020 on 10 June for its batch of Year 6 students. More than 440 students took part in a total of 29 live webinar sessions hosted by more than 60 faculty staff, admission officers and representatives from 9 local universities and organisations.

Even in the midst of these unprecedented times, we remain committed to our focus on supporting our students. As we learn to navigate this time of transformative change, the school leverages on technology to engage our students. Virtual Cafés were set up to connect our students with representatives from the wider academic community.

The event kicked off with students attending the pre-recorded keynote address by Professor Tan Tai Yong, President of Yale-NUS College, on the Student Learning Space (SLS). The school is indeed privileged and grateful to Professor Tan who took time to share his perspectives and insights on the topic “Being Human: The Fundamental of Readying Yourself for the Future”. A smaller group of students also had the opportunity to engage Professor Tan in a live discussion of what it means to ready oneself for a complex and unpredictable future. Professor Tan opines that one has to “be prepared for changes, be guided by values, be curious and keep on learning, and be humble” in preparing for a turbulent and disruptive world.

A highlight of the event was the University Café Conversations, where students were given the opportunity to meet and interact with staff from faculties and organisations of their choice. Over the course of three hourly concurrent sessions, students plugged into virtual Café rooms to hear from various panels of speakers and representatives from local universities as well as British Council and EducationUSA, who shared information on academic programmes, scholarships, university life, overseas study, career options, and more.

Following a lunch break, students went on to complete a Personal Statement Writing module on SLS and browse e-resources that showcase a myriad of universities and scholarships opportunities.

Overall, it has been a meaningful and fulfilling day for our Year 6 students. As Ng Xin Yu from 20Y6C12 puts it, “I thoroughly enjoyed the programme today, thank you teachers for organising this!”
