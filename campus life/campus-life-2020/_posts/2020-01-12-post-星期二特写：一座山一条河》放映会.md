我校华文部与人文部于新学年开学的第一天（1月2日），邀请了新传媒中文时事节目《星期二特写》的制作团队前来我校表演艺术中心举办《一座山一条河》放映会。我校全体中二以及中四的学生出席了这次的放映会。

去年是新加坡开埠200周年，《星期二特写》制作团队摄制了三集历史纪录片《一座山一条河》，通过展现出福康宁山和新加坡河过去200年来的发展与演变，来述说新加坡的历史。当天所放映的是《新加坡河》上集。

以下是同学的反思：  
王泓曜（4H）：“一直以来，历史课本都把莱佛士等大人物称为建国英雄。新加坡还做了几个雕像，纪念这些人，今天却发现我们祖先的苦干其实一样重要。如果说新加坡是个摩天大楼，那祖先们便是大楼底下稳稳的基础。这基础支撑着新加坡，新加坡才可以持续发展。因此，祖先们的努力是无比的重要。除此之外，我觉得DJ实在很了不起。他说话又顺畅，又很吸引观众，一般人无法达到这么高的水平，因此觉得这工作实在不容易。最后，也觉得制作组实在不容易。看似简单的电视节目，背后却花上超过一整年的时间，令我很敬佩。从今天开始，我会多加使用媒体资源来学习华文。”

通过这次的放映会，同学们除了体会到先驱的辛勤付出，了解到媒体业背后的酸甜苦辣，也更能将华文华语活学活用。

On 2 Jan, the Chinese Department and Humanities Department jointly invited the Chinese Current Affairs team of Mediacorp to conduct a special screening of “Tuesday Report: A Hill and A River” in school. Produced to mark Singapore’s bicentennial year in 2019, this 3-episode documentary traces the history of Singapore through the developments and evolution of Fort Canning and the Singapore River. The Year 2 and Year 4 cohorts attended this special screening.

Here are two pieces of reflection from our students:

“I learnt that the Singapore River played an important role in the development of Singapore into a thriving economic hub, bringing Singapore’s name to the world’s stage. With traders across the world flocking to Singapore to trade, they brought along with them many job opportunities as well and attracted many migrants to stay in Singapore. Many people played their part in this development such as traders, investors, coolies, and the government. Investors saw opportunities to purchase valuable pieces of land and develop critical infrastructure. Coolies came from abroad, mostly from China, carrying out menial duties to earn and repatriate money back to their homeland. They also brought with them rich Chinese culture. Some chose to settle in Singapore and hence contributed to the diverse Chinese population from different dialect groups with many interesting heritage, enhancing the cultural the vibrancy of the island. Their efforts led to the rise in standard of living of the island state. It can be learnt from the people who played their part in this development that with perseverance, seemingly unachievable goals can be achieved.” – Aw Guangyang Amos (20Y4K)

“I have learnt more about the past of the Singapore River. The Singapore River was of deep significance to the people in Singapore in the past because they mainly relied on trading in the past and thus it was their main livelihood and source of income. Since 1819, many traders have been attracted to Singapore to carry out trade as Singapore was an entrepot along the India-China trade route. Before the 1980s, many coolies used to work near the Singapore River, carrying heavy goods up and down many ships docked at the side of the river. The goods they carried included large packets of rice, which they tasted to ensure that they were of the best quality. The coolies would then eat the rice for lunch, along with a small olive at the side. This helped me to visualise and understand the conditions the coolies worked in as well as how Singapore succeeded in turning into a bustling settlement from a small fishing village. I feel that this experience is extremely meaningful because it allowed me to further understand how documentaries such as these are created. I also got to engage with a famous Singaporean DJ to find out more about their job scope. I feel that this helped me to appreciate Chinese better as the DJ managed to engage us purely by speaking in Mandarin. I am grateful to be given this opportunity and I hope that there will be similar opportunities in the future.” – Darrius Lee (20Y2J)
