We are proud to share that 3 Dunmanians received Special Awards from the Ministry of Education. These special awards recognise students’ diverse achievements in both academic and non-academic spheres, including their contributions to the community.

Year 1 student Summer Renee Quek (20Y1A) is one of the recipients of the Lee Kuan Yew Award for All-Round Excellence. This award recognises well-rounded students who have excelled in both academic and non-academic spheres, and who exemplifies the qualities articulated in our desired outcomes of education.

Year 5 student Valene Lim Jia Xuan (20Y5C42) is one of the recipients of the Prime Minister’s Book Prize, an annual award for bilingualism.

Last but not least, Valerie Tan Yi Jie from the 19Y6C31 is one of the recipients of the Lee Kuan Yew Award for Mathematics and Science. This award is aimed at promoting excellence in Mathematics and Science.

Congratulations on your achievements, Summer, Valene and Valerie!
