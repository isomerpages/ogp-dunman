We are glad to share that two of our Year 6 H3 Economics students, Chang Yu Qing and Peng You Yun have attained a merit award for their jointly-written essay at the annual essay writing competition jointly organised by the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore and Economic Society of Singapore! This competition invites participants to critically analyse the extent and nature to which the government should intervene in markets especially with the shift towards a digital economy. After weeks of research into pre-existing literature and discussions, our two students were able to explore deeper into the existing economic problems faced by Singapore and gain a better understanding of the constraints of regulators in Singapore. Congratulations, Yu Qing and You Yun!
