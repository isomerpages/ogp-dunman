The Year 1 Parent-Child Day was held online this year on 22 August. It aimed to help parents deepen their understanding of their childâ€™s role in school and how they could offer their child advice and encouragement in their educational journey. The Y1 Dunmanians had to explore various creative web games such as skribbl, virtual pictionary and treasure hunts to involve both their peers as well as parents of their classmates. Besides showcasing their talents and presenting snippets of school life to the virtual audience, the Year 1s also showed appreciation to their parents by making paracord bracelets for them. Despite the challenges faced this year, both Dunmanians and their parents were adaptive and enthusiastic for the event!
