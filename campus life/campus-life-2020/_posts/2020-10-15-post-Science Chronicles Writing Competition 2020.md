Congratulations to Beatrice Teh Eng Hui (5C42), Huang Shi Rui (4L) and Wee Zhuo Lin (4L) for their winning entries for the Science Chronicles Writing Competition 2020! Beatrice won the First Prize for her story “Full Moon”, a creative imagining of the future world and ending with a poignant reminder of the ethical ramifications of the possible futures opened by scientific research. Shi Rui’s and Zhuo Lin’s co-written entry “Unparalleled” won the Merit Prize. The story speaks of a group of semi-organic intelligent beings, and like Beatrice’s piece, ends with a beautiful note that humans are unique and irreplaceable.
