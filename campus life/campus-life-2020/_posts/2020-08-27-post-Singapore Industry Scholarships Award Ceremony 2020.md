The Singapore Industry Scholarships Award Ceremony was held virtually on 14 August 2020. The ceremony was graced by Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman, Second Minister for Education on 14 with the scholars’ respective Sponsoring Organisations. We would like to extend our sincere congratulations to Lau Jing Yi Pearlyn, from Class of 2019 and Amelia Tan Jin Yu, from Class of 2018 for their award.

Pearlyn will be embarking on a journey with GlaxoSmithKline (Glaxo Wellcome Manufacturing Pte Ltd), while Amelia will be with MediaTek Singapore Pte Ltd.

Both alumni shared with us how they felt about her award and offered some words of encouragement for their juniors.

“I am grateful and honoured to receive the SgIS Scholarship under GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) to pursue Chemistry in National University of Singapore (NUS). Financial benefits aside, the SgIS Scholarship with GSK allows me to be part of a large, leading global pharmaceutical company and hence the opportunity to learn from the experts and esteemed scientists around the world. I hope that my future work as a chemist in GSK can help to streamline the manufacturing process and improve the quality of medicines and other healthcare products, and hence make a difference in the well-being of patients worldwide.

Advice to my juniors: Don’t be afraid to venture into the unknown! Personally, my friends and teachers gave me a lot of support and confidence to step out of my comfort zone, so enjoy your time in Dunman High and make full use of the supportive and nurturing environment. Just take a deep breath and do your best!” – Pearlyn Lau (Class of 2019)

“I am currently studying Computer Science in NUS and I really like the curriculum and academic rigor. I am very happy to be awarded this scholarship as it provides me with a better sense of direction of where I am headed and gives me a head start in knowing what my future job expects of me! I am also able to communicate with my sponsoring organization who can guide me on what modules to take to be better equipped with the skill sets required in the industry. Knowing how significant technology is in our lives today, I have chosen to join a department that is working on Artificial Intelligence where I see a lot of potential and growth prospects.

To all juniors, my advice would be to keep working hard. Even if you don’t manage to get a full term scholarship, don’t be dejected as there are plenty of mid-term scholarships that you can still apply for! When one door closes, another door will open!” – Amelia Tan (Class of 2018)
