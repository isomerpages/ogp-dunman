The Moot Parliament Programme (MPP) is a programme organised by MOE’s Gifted Education Branch for IP and IB school students to better understand Singapore’s model of democratic government and its legislation process. This is done through research on various social and community issues, learning about the impact of government policies and legislation, and role-playing the government in its decision-making processes. The teams work with student mentors from the law faculty of National University of Singapore (NUS) and Singapore Management University as well as expert mentors to produce Written Bills and Public Policy Papers.

Our Year 4 students Christopher Ang, Wang Yihui, Jesline Yu and Shelia Teo (from top left, clockwise) have done the school proud at the Moot Parliament Programme Debates 2020! Amongst 24 teams from IP and IB schools, their Legalisation of Surrogacy Bill clinched the 3rd Best Written Bill. They were also the winning team in Debate Session 1 where they spoke as the Opposition Team on the Homemaker Welfare Scheme against ACS(I). We are proud of their hard work and accomplishments. Congratulations!
