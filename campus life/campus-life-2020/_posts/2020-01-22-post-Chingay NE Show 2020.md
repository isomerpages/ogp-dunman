Last Saturday (18 Jan 2020), the Year 1 students were treated to a night of colourful extravaganza at the Chingay NE Show 2020 “Colours in Harmony”, a dynamic showcase of Singapore’s multiculturalism and diversity. 6000 volunteers were involved in co-presenting this People’s Parade that also marks the People’s Association’s 60 years of community building. Our students were thrilled and wowed over by the 90-minute long fantastic displays of Singapore’s strength in diversity.
