In Phase 2 of Singapore’s reopening, schools once again come back to live as we welcome our students back. Adding to the vibrancy was the annual Distinguished Speaker Series (DSS) organised by the Humanities Department. The first of the DSS was held on 24 June 2020. The platform was, naturally, a live webinar. The topic was, befittingly, COVID-19 Budget 2020. In the information-rich 1.5 hours, the guest lecturer, Dr Sng Hui Ying of Nanyang Technological University (NTU), and an old girl of Dunman High School, dissected the main budget and the subsequent three supplementary budgets to lay bare the anatomy of the government’s fiscal response to this generational crisis. To help students better appreciate the design of Budget 2020, Dr Sng made a comparison with the budget measures implemented in other recessions, and the relief package for the 2003 SARS outbreak.
