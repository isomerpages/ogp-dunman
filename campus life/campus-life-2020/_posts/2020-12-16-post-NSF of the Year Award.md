The school congratulates our alumnus Bai Yuanqing from the Class of 2017 on being one of the recipients of the NSF of the Year Award. Yuanqing was a volleyball player and sports leader during his Senior High days. He shares with us his thoughts on receiving this award:

“It’s a tremendous honour to be receiving this award and to be recognised by The Singapore Army. At the same time we must not forget that in any organisation, it takes the collaborative effort of many for things to run smoothly. Although the award is given to a few, there are many who contributed immensely. As such this award is a chance to celebrate the contributions of all the NSFs and NSmen.

To my fellow Dunmanians – for many of you guys, it will be an eye-opening experience. You’ll be forced out of your comfort zone and be exposed to things you might have never seen before. You’ll also find yourself in situations that you’d rather not be in. Find something to push you on. You need to find hope. Don’t be afraid to find help and support during the hard times. Try new things during your two years. Learn more about yourself and grow!”
