On 17 February, Dunman High commemorated the Total Defence Day (TDD). The onset of COVID-19 added a new urgency to this year’s TDD as students were made aware of how Singapore, a small country with limited resources, could be adversely impacted by transboundary issues. Minister for Defence Dr Ng Eng Hen shared in his speech the relevance of the six pillars of TDD that could help Singapore overcome the crisis just as it did for SARS 17 years ago. The newly added sixth pillar in 2019 – Digital Defence – was timely and effective for the nation to cope with the devastating effects of fake news and hate speech emanating from COVID-19. In dovetailing the message of TDD, the Citizenship Education (CE) Committee specially designed a lesson package that captured important learning points for the cohorts. Through presentations led by CE ambassadors, students were better equipped to understand threats such as environmental degradation, COVID-19 and its attendant problems. The lesson exposed to them threats that many Singaporeans often overlooked and it also entreated them to take actions to mitigate the threats, such as playing a greater role in combating climate change and practising greater responsibility in keeping the virus at bay. They also took a stand against unsavoury actions undertaken by some quarters that spread fake news and hate speech which might sow discord in society during a crisis. Hence, it is important to maintain an attitude of unity and vigilance when dealing with crises. The students also took comfort that Singapore, despite facing crisis after crisis, has been successful in managing threats and this is attributed to the forward-thinking of the government and the resilience and determination of the people.
