We are pleased to share that Regina Yap En Na of 20Y1H – a student in the English Department’s Young Writer’s Programme in Dunman High — was a finalist in the National Poetry Competition 2020 and her poem garnered her a Merit award. The annual competition was organised by Poetry Festival Singapore as a platform for aspiring poets and wordsmiths in the growing local literary scene. The theme for the 6th edition of the competition is ‘Legacies and Creation. Legacies enmesh the poet into an artistic chain that bridges the present to the past and the future. The poet creates art with the building blocks of traditions or legacies in order to imagine a new world. In doing so, a poet can inspire transformative actions.
