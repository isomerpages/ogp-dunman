On 29 July 2020, a group of Dunman High student leaders had the opportunity to join the South East District Youth Conference. Held annually by the South East CDC, this year’s focus was on how the community can come together to assist the needy, bond the people and connect the community — especially in the post Covid-19 new normal. Through this session with Dr Mohd Maliki Osman and special guest speaker Mr Divian Nair, founder of WeAreMajulah and radio presenter, students got the opportunity to listen in on their sharing and experience a Q&A session pertaining to current challenges young people face in their journey in volunteering. A fruitful and insightful session, the speakers also managed to touch on topics related to the everyday lives of young people like social media, academic stress and searching for your own passion. Participants gained key takeaways and reminders such as practising discernment on social media platforms and the importance of finding their own purpose in serving the community. The Dunman High student leaders gained a deeper understanding of volunteerism in their own communities and were inspired to kickstart initiatives to encourage fellow schoolmates to join in the movement of volunteerism.
