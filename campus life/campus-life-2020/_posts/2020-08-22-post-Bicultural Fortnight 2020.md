“It’s a bird! It’s a plane! It’s SUPERMAN!”

On 17 August, various heroes were spotted making their way through the gates of Dunman High School and crossing into a whole new world. From action heroes like Ironman and The Hulk to everyday heroes like doctors and teachers, the creativity of students and teachers knew no bounds.

This was all part of the ‘Superhero Dress-up Day’ organised by the English Department’s Bicultural Fortnight Committee to kick start the English Week.

Apart from dressing up for the occasion, students also participated in exciting activities including a live interactive play on Zoom by How Drama, a talk by everyday hero Dr Tan Lai Yong, a TedTalk Showdown and various online creative writing competitions, all revolving around the theme of “Superheroes”.

In this week of hearing and reading more about heroes, Dunmanians have been inspired to become real-life heroes to the people around them.
