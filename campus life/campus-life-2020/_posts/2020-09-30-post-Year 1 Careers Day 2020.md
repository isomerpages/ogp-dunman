Our Year 1 students were privileged to learn from 10 parents and speakers about their work experience in the session “I’m Thankful to You – Appreciating All Walks of Life”. This session was co-organised by the DHS Parent Support Group and the Careers, Scholarships and Higher Education Committee in school.

The session aimed to support students in learning to appreciate the diversity of jobs and how all jobs are important in their own way. It is hoped that our young Dunmanians have taken a little inspiration from these speakers – to learn to take pride and have a sense of purpose in all that they do, and to know that for whatever they do, it is always more meaningful when people around them benefit from the work done.

We are very thankful to all our parents and speakers for taking the time and effort to share with our Year 1 Dunmanians!
