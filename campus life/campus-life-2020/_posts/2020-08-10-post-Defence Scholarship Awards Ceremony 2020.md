The **Defence Scholarship Awards Ceremony** was held on 29 July 2020 virtually, graced by Defence Minister, Dr Ng Eng Hen. We would like to extend our sincere congratulations to our graduates who received scholarships at this year’s ceremony. They have pledged themselves to serve the noble cause of ensuring the peace and security of Singapore, to protect our country against all security threats and to give Singaporeans the confidence that our homeland and loved ones are safe.

Our Dunmanians shared with us how they feel about their award, and what they would like to say to the younger Dunmanians.

“Receiving this scholarship is a very humbling experience. I am grateful to be given this opportunity, for me to pursue a technical job I am passionate about and to work for a cause that deeply resonates with me. As I start my university journey with the PSC Scholarship, I hope to be able to grow and improve in the ways I serve our community and to effectively contribute to Singapore’s progress as a country and; in the defence sector, to better understand the issues in Singapore and develop a vision for Singapore’s future. 

To my juniors, grades are seemingly a stepping stone to where you want to get to but passion is what brings you far and sustains you in doing what you believe in so don’t give up on what you hope to do be and work hard for what you want to achieve.” — Lim En Ning (Class of 2019)

“It’s a tremendous honour receiving the SAF Merit Scholarship. Being in an ops squadron for a year after commissioning made me more committed to the role that I can play in national defence. I am going to read Psychology in NTU, I hope that the soft skills and knowledge that I pick up in university will help my career in a people-oriented organisation like the SAF. As the challenges we face evolve, I wish to be part of a SAF that invests in both its people and hardware that are capable in dealing and overcoming such challenges. I hope that the support for National Service and the SAF will continue and even improve, because it is with peace and security that Singapore will be able to achieve greater heights.

I encourage juniors to not be disheartened if they have not found their purpose, and just continue to work hard. Enjoy your time in school and make memories that you can look back at in years to come.” – Chuah Chong Koon (Class of 2017)

“I am truly grateful and honoured to receive this scholarship from DSTA, with which I will pursue a degree in physics in NUS. Indeed, I can’t wait to harness my passion for physics to contribute to the defence of Singapore and safeguard her national security and interests.

I have always loved investigating how things work and why objects or living things are the way they are. I realised that physics embodies many fundamental axioms on the laws that govern physical processes, be they of nature, man or machine, that we see today. I hope to reverse-engineer the principles of technology with physics concepts to contribute to more cutting-edge defence solutions for Singapore such as quantum sensing and satellite surveillance.

Looking back, I am indeed very thankful to all the teachers of Dunman High for being so dedicated and nurturing in helping me overcome the challenges I faced as well as encouraging me to explore concepts that fascinated me.

To all my fellow brothers and sisters in the Dunmanian family, I urge you to keep an open mind and find out where your passion and interests lie. No subject is easy, especially in Senior High. I even had second thoughts about physics, my favourite subject, when the going got tough. While good grades may be the more immediate outcome we hope and work for, it is ultimately, the process of finding joy, creativity and meaning in learning that will sustain us for the long haul.” – Lo Yong Ern Matthew (Class of 2017)

“My name is Tham Jin Lin, a Year 9 this year, and a recipient of the DSTA Scholarship. I am currently in NUS studying Computer Science which is where my interest lies. I applied for DSTA Scholarship because I believe in working for a greater meaning than just for profits, and DSTA offers that – to contribute to national defence. I became more convinced after witnessing first-hand some of the end-products DSTA has developed, and I want to be part of developing that.

Being awarded with the DSTA Scholarship surprised me, because like many others, I did not expect that I was going to come out on top of all the competition. Interviews were not easy, and I had little to no experience in going for them. However, I believed that if I was going to do something, I should commit and give my best shot. Good things will not come easy, and I realised you just got to keep fighting for them and persevere.

Academic excellence alone is not enough. In meeting other people, be it in interviews or other settings, what stands out more will always be your unique self and your beliefs rather than your academic prowess. When you found your core and personal beliefs, with right social skills, you will start reaching places you never thought was possible for you.

With that, good luck for the preparation towards A Levels, but just remember that A Levels is not the end-all, so do not be myopic in the pursuit for grades. I believe self-development and growth should be the ultimate continuing goal.” – Tham Jin Lin (Class of 2017)
