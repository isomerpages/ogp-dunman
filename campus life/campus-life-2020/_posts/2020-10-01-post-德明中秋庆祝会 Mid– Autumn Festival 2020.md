中秋佳节月儿圆，圆月全家聚一堂，桂花散香飘祥瑞，嫦娥送福美万年！2020，德明中秋，如期而至。

今年，由于疫情的缘故，德明中秋活动改为网上庆祝。在双文化委员会老师们的带领下，德明双文化学生理事会与语特理事会精心准备了一系列别具一格的网上活动，与大家共庆中秋佳节！

9月18日，网上庆祝会一开始，刘德荣校长便登场为大家致词。刘校长的精彩演讲不仅引导大家树立积极的人生观，更让大家加深了对中秋的了解。接着，德明华乐团等学生团体也为大家呈献了美妙绝伦的表演。精彩的古筝、合唱、爵士舞等表演令人应接不暇，让人叹为观止！精心准备的文化视频也让人大开眼界，让大家更加了解了有关中秋的人物和美食。大家欣赏完庆祝视频后，还踊跃参加了之后的有奖问答活动。获奖名单会在10月1日中秋节当天公布。除此之外，精心筹划的趣味比赛如“画灯笼”比赛以及活动花絮也为这次的中秋庆祝会增添了不少乐趣。

当然，除了线上庆祝会，中秋主题的各式灯笼也挂满正心园周围，校园内到处洋溢着浓郁的节日气氛。

2020德明中秋庆祝会就在这和睦温馨的氛围中圆满落幕！最后，祝大家中秋快乐，阖家幸福！

The annual Dunman High Mid-Autumn Festival this year took place in the form of an e-Celebration. With the help of teachers, BSP Council and CLEP Council, the 2020 Dunman High Mid-Autumn E-celebration was successfully held on 18th September.  
At the beginning of the celebration, our principal Mr Tony Low gave an insightful speech which provided us with a better understanding of the traditions of Mid-Autumn Festival.

Our Performing Arts groups – the Dunman High Chinese Orchestra and Guzheng presented wonderful performances like “Hua Hao Yue Yuan”and “Dan Yuan Ren Chang Jiu”. There were also other exciting performances by our dancers and Year 5 students who sang “Yue Liang Dai Biao Wo De Xin.”  
Besides that, our Bicultural Studies Programme and Chinese Language Elective Programme councils also prepared an interesting video which shared more about the history and culture of the Mid-Autumn Festival. After watching the video, students could choose to participate in the quiz session and win gift vouchers if they answered the questions correctly.

In addition, students were also encouraged to participate in various competitions such as the Lantern Painting Contest to win attractive prizes.  
Besides the online celebration, a great celebratory atmosphere has also been fostered within the school, with beautiful lantern decorations all around the foyer and Zheng Xin Yuan.

We wish everyone a very happy Mid-Autumn Festival!
