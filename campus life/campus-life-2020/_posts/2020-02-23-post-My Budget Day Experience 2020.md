‘My Budget Day Experience’ programme is jointly organised by the Parliament and the Ministry of Finance. It provides an opportunity for students to observe the delivery of the Budget Speech ‘live’ at the Parliament House and is part of Parliament’s ongoing efforts to involve students in matters of national interest. This experience is meant to help students better understand the key concerns of the Government and the need to plan for present-day and future allocation of the Nation’s resources and funds.

Below is a reflection by Tan Yu Jia and Wong Jun Hong Shaun of 20Y6C32 who attended ‘My Budget Day Experience 2020’.

_‘On 18 Feb we were at the Parliament to witness Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Mr Heng Swee Keat deliver the Budget Speech through the My Budget Day Experience 2020 programme. The Budget Speech is a once a year event where the Finance Minister shares the proposed allocation of the government’s funds (and, more broadly, resources) with the rest of the Parliament and the Singapore people. Through this experience, we gained deeper insights into the inner workings of a Parliament session. More importantly, the care that the DPM took in communicating the importance of tackling immediate needs while not losing sight of the adaptations necessary to meet long-term structural shifts, the trade-offs involved, and the considerations taken in weighing those trade-offs helped us appreciate the complexities of planning a nation’s budget. Through how the government works out the budget allocation between the different sectors, we learned about the economic and social priorities of Singapore. What we learned in Economics about equitable tax systems and the use of taxes and subsidies to achieve efficient economic outcomes also came alive for us through the various policy enhancements announced. The following day, we shared our Budget Day Experience with our classmates during a tutorial lesson and highlighted the learning points that could be applied to subjects such as Economics and General Paper. The sharing process also helped us consolidate our learning from this experience.’_
