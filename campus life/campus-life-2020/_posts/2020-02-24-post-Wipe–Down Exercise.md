Dunmanians rallied together when the DORSCON was raised to orange by participating in the Wipe-Down Exercise to drive home the message of personal hygiene and responsibility. Many heeded the call by donating empty bottles and preparing liquid soap to facilitate the on-going event. Students and teachers took the opportunity to turn the COVID-19 crisis into a mass-cleaning exercise when they scrupulously wiped down their own tables in class and staff rooms, and many also voluntarily wiped the canteen tables after their food consumption. Clearly, while the nation witnessed some quarters who selfishly hoarded surgical masks and food items or reselling them at inflated prices, the display of team spirit in Dunman High was a good collective effort in the fight against the virus. It is through staying united and not giving in to irrational fear that the whole nation can emerge stronger in dealing with a common threat.
