As part of developing student leadership in our Dunmanians, the Student Leadership Development Committee organised its annual Sports Leaders Camp on 20 July 2020 for our 23 Y5 Sports Leaders.

This year, the Y5 Sports Leaders Camp took an unprecedented approach as an e-Camp where our Sports Leaders gathered online to undergo a series of leadership training and team building activities.

Our Sports Leaders were first introduced to the various dimensions of Leadership (Self-Leadership, Team-Leadership and Thought-Leadership) followed by a workshop on Visionary Leadership. Drawing on the Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership Model by Jim Kouzes and Barry Posner, our Sports Leaders learnt about how they can inspire a shared vision by equipping themselves with ways to envision the future and enlist others.

Our Sports Leaders also had the opportunity to learn to work with one another through activities which require effective communication and collaboration skills. Their skills were put to the test through an online platform where they had to complete the given tasks within a stipulated time .

Looking to the year ahead, our three committees, consisting of the Media Team, Athletes’ Support and Internal Welfare, discussed their work plans for their remaining term of service. This was followed by a presentation to the whole team for a collective and consultative discussion.

To mark the end of this year’s Y5 Sports Leaders Camp, our Sports Leaders took on the Values Challenge where they turn their shared values of friendship, happiness and responsibility into action. By performing three sets of workouts in accordance to the letters that make up the words of these shared values, the Values Challenge was intended to empower our Sports Leaders to align their actions with the shared values consistently in order to synergise as a team.

“The team must know what the vision or end goal is. With a vision, the members will be able to know the “WHY” of the task we are working on. This allows us to be more motivated to do our respective parts to the best of our abilities. So, the leader must communicate the vision clearly to the members.” – Choo Hsien Yew, Athlete Support Committee IC

“Change the way you phrase your sentence. Instead of “I think we should”, use “let us…”. This will change the whole atmosphere of the situation and make everyone in the team feel involved and more motivated.” – Lucas Poh Fang Yin
