On 1st August, the school held our inaugural e-Scholarships Cafe, inviting guest speakers from scholarships organisations as well as our alumni to share their perspectives on scholarships with our students via a Zoom webinar session. The organisations included Changi Airport Group, DSTA, Ministry of Defence and Singapore Prison Services amongst others. The session aimed to allow our students to better understand the commitments of a scholar and the relevance of scholarships to career paths thus enabling them to make more well-informed decisions on their future options. Leveraging the breakout room function in Zoom, concurrent breakout sessions via a speed-dating format were held to facilitate greater engagement between our students and the speakers in a small group setting. Many good questions were asked by our students during the breakout sessions. It was a fruitful day where our students gained many pearls of wisdom, leaving the session with a better understanding of the purpose of scholarships as well as a broader understanding of the different scholarship opportunities. We will like to extend our heartfelt thanks to the speakers for their time and for sharing so candidly with our students.
