The MEP Fiesta of 2020 celebrated various Music-related activities involving MEP students and was open to the school. Some of the highlights included Indian Music and Malay Music workshops for students to understand music of other cultures at a deeper level. The MEP Fiesta was held in August in line with the Circuit Breaker safety measures. There was also a Composition sharing workshop titled SMASH held on 28 August. Year 6 MEP students also rounded off their final year with a heartwarming Farewell Recital on 20 August on library@esplanade’s Facebook platform.

On 15 August, the Year 5 MEP students organized their 10th CRASH Concert. This concert is a platform for MEP students to showcase their talent and develop confidence in performing. To exercise students’ leadership and develop their organisational skills, this year’s concert was helmed by MEP Scholarship recipient Theodore Chan (5C37) and his team of MEP Scholarship recipients Chan Xin Tong (5C48) and Joseph Tan (5C36) supported by the Year 5 MEP students. The concert featured solo performances with works by Corelli, Debussy and Marcelo and works for voice, harp, oboe were even featured! There was also delightful Chinese music played on the erhu by Isanne Chan (6C37) and 2020 Steinway Piano Competition winner Ong Zi Rui (5C48) performed one of his winning entry pieces. The concert also featured 2019 National Piano and Violin Competition winner and External Y3 MEP student Tan Mun Hon from Tanjong Katong Secondary School giving a flawless performance on the violin. This year’s concert also featured original compositions and arrangements: Year 2 External MEP students performed their waltz medley, Chan Hao Li (5C36) presented his original composition for flute solo and the Year 3 HM MEP class performed a percussion ensemble work. One of the evening’s highlights included an entertaining skit by the Year 4 HM MEP featuring the different MEP students in a class, led by Ryan Koh (4C) with video editing by Annabelle Tan (4F). This video was also shortlisted for the MOE MEP Combined Concert Open Call. The MEP students’ acting and tongue-in-cheek references to music instruments and melodies were certainly entertaining! The concert concluded with the traditional So Long, Farewell goodbyes but in a creative video collage edited by Tang Yu Jun (5C48)!

Overall the concert was fun, engaging and well supported by a good crowd of families and friends of MEP students online with more than a 1000 views. The youtube platform also saw a lively chat amongst Dunman High School students, external students and friends who were engaged in the live concert throughout. It was heartening to see the positive support during these challenging times for everyone and young performers in the creative arena.

For now it is a farewell from the MEP family and we will see you all again next year!

Personal reflection from Chan Xin Tong (5C48):

The experience performing and planning the CRASH concert this year was very different compared to previous years as it had to be held online due to the COVID-19 restrictions. While many of us were disappointed that we could not hold a live concert, we also saw it as taking up the challenge to plan a meaningful online concert and work within our constraints.

As it was our first time organising an online concert, we were skeptical of the outreach of the concert at first. But to our surprise, many people actually came online to watch the concert! It was really memorable and fun interacting with the audience online through the YouTube Live Chat, and it was rather heartwarming to see an audience coming together to enjoy the music and performances prepared by our MEP students, even though we were physically apart.

The support and guidance from my teachers, seniors, juniors and batchmates have definitely made this journey an emotionally fulfilling one.

While we were not able to complete everything we set out to, this experience has taught me to be quick to adapt to changes and to also remain optimistic when working through these challenges. At the same time, it also reminded me that we should not be too hard on ourselves when things do not go our way and view our mistakes as a learning opportunity to do better in the future.
