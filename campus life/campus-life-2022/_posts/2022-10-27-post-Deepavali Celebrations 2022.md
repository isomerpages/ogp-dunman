Deepavali is recently celebrated by the staff and students of Dunman High School. For the month of October, the school has been adorned in bright and colourful decorations and displays to mark this auspicious festival. These decorations and displays are centred around Deepavali lamps, which symbolise the victory of good over evil, as well as auspicious animals in the Indian culture, such as the elephant and peacock.

The Junior High (JH) students took part in a series of hands-on activities – Celebrating our Diversity, where they put their handicraft skills to the test in the designing of **Rangoli-Kolam** and decoration of **clay lamps**. A sharing was also presented by **Mardolker Meera of 4F** during the JH morning assembly on 21 Oct 2022 (Fri), where she touched on the significance of Deepavali for her and her family, as well as their experiences in celebrating this auspicious occasion. Information on the history and significance of Deepavali were also shared with staff and students. In addition, staff were treated to delicious Deepavali snacks by the school’s SRWC.

It is hoped that through these activities, Dunmanians will be able to gain a greater awareness and deeper appreciation of the significance of Deepavali, and strengthen their multi-racial and multicultural perspectives.
