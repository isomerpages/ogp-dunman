A group of our Y5 students â€“ Abigail Hsu Rui-En (22Y5C32), Ang Qi Yuan (22Y5C31), Tit Shao En (22Y5C31) and Pang Qi Heng (22Y5C31) participated in the 2022 Swift Explorers Singapore organised by Crescent Girls School. They designed an app to cater to the needs of Senior Citizens, motivating them to step out of their comfort zone to make friends and socialise.

Their app was featured during the Apple Swift Explorer Singapore Showcase 2022, and Channel 8 News came to our school to interview them last Dec. Below is the YouTube link of the interview.
