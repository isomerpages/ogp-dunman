**20th Elementz Science Project Competition**

The Elementz Science Project Competition has taken place annually since 2001 for primary and lower secondary students. Organised by Anderson Secondary School, this science fair aims to generate interest in scientific study through investigative-type projects in science. This year, the event took place on 19 July 2022 (Judging) and 4 August 2022 (Sharing and Prize Presentation).

Three Year 2 Science Mentorship Programme (SMP2) teams represented Dunman High School and submitted their research findings. Two projects were shortlisted for the Final Judging.

During the sharing, Guest-of-Honour, Professor Sow Chorng Haur, from the Department of Physics at National University of SIngapore, inspired participants with his own science research journey, and highlighted essential qualities that a researcher should possess such as:

*   the ability to think out of the box 
*   never giving up in the face of adversity 
*   having fun while experimenting 

Through this science fair, the teams pursued their interests in Science through hands-on research. The teams faced failures during the experimentation process, but learnt how to work together and found solutions to overcome the problems faced. 

We are pleased to share the stellar showing of our teams at the 20th Elementz Science Project Competition and Exhibition:
