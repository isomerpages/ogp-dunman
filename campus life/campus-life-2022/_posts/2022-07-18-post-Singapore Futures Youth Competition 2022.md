This June holiday, a team of Dunman High students participated in the Singapore Futures Youth Competition 2022, a 5-day event organised by the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy. This year’s competition theme was “Towards a Sustainable and Resilient Singapore 2050”, which challenged our participants to envision Singapore’s sustainable development in the future. 

The competition began with a 3-day futures thinking workshop run by the LKYSPP faculty where participants were introduced to public policy and exposed to the complexities of policymaking. They also learnt to apply futures thinking methodologies to develop scenarios for the future of Singapore’s sustainable development, under the guidance of industry leaders. 

In the competition segment, participants were formed into groups consisting of members from all different schools. We are proud to announce that three Dunmanians, namely Abigail Hsu Rui-En (5C32), Laiyla Alisha (5C21) and Ashley Teh Hui Ying (6C12) made it through to the finals with their teams. Ashley’s team went on to clinch the Second Place with a compelling and dynamic portrayal of the future of sustainability in Singapore’s economy while Abigail and Laiyla both finished with Commendation awards with futures centering around the management of waste from the F&B industry and food security respectively. Congratulations Dunmanians!
