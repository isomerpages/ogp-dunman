On 1 July 2022, Dunman High School (DHS) was honoured to host a group of delegates from Cambridge Assessment International Education led by Ms. Christine Ã–zden, the Chief Executive of Cambridge Assessment International Education and Directors from Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board.

The visitors joined students in the classroom to observe how learning processes were enhanced with the affordance of technology at DHS. This was part of the DHS 6-year Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP) where the school continuously refined and sharpened its T&L practices in a tech-enabled environment with its dedicated teachers for Year 1 to 6 students.

Technology was harnessed in the Junior High Chemistry classroom using the Student Learning Space (SLS) platform to promote thinking and discussion. The Interactive Thinking Tools (ITT) within SLS enhanced student participation in predicting, observing and proposing explanations as they deepened their understanding of concepts and knowledge. In the Junior High Humanities classroom, students learnt collaboratively through tech-empowered platforms such as GIS map and Padlet to describe the categorisation of natural hazards based on their origin and causes.

With the teacher being the Lesson Designer and the Facilitator of Technology-Mediated Learning Experiences for students, the visitors also gleaned how technology could connect, engage and motivate students to achieve subject-specific objectives in Senior High Mathematics to foster conceptual change with visualisation using SLS and Geogebra.

The visitors were delighted to see how the school used technology to create a participative, connected and reflective environment to nurture future-ready learners. Learning with technology occurred in different learning contexts as teachers designed purposeful lessons for students to derive joy and satisfaction in their learning with their Personal Learning Device (PLD). Students became more competent in applying digital literacy in the classroom and beyond with greater student agency and ownership of learning.
