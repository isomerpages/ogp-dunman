This year, the school’s annual Careers, Scholarships and Higher Education (CSHE) Day took place on 25 May 2022 (Wednesday). This day is specially set aside for Dunmanians to learn about the changing university and industry landscape as they work towards their aspirations preparing themselves yourself for the future.

We kickstarted the event with a keynote address by Professor Lily Kong, President of Singapore Management University and Lee Kong Chian Chair Professor of Social Sciences to share with our students on the topic: “Developing multiple citizenships: Shaping individuals, forging identities”. Prof Kong spoke about the dispositions that one should possess and the shift in mental model across the society as we prepare ourselves for the future.

This was followed by our Youth Alumni’s sharing. By young alumni who have been there and done that, they shared with our Dunmanians their experiences in deciding and preparing for their scholarships and university decisions.

After lunch, speakers from various universities, scholarship providers and industries spoke with the Dunmanians to help them gain a better understanding of the expectations of the universities, scholarship providers and future employers. More than 50 sharing sessions were lined up for the students to support them in acquiring useful and up-to-date knowledge to help them make a well-informed decision for their future aspirations.  
Dunmanians found the perspectives shared useful and informative. They have gained much from the personal anecdotes of the speakers and have definitely gain much insight about being a future-ready individual.
