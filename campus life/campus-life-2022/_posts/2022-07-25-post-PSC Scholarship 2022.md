Graced by Minister Chan Chun Sing, the Public Service Commission Scholarship Ceremony 2022 was held on 20 July (Wed). We are proud to share that Lim Jia Xuan Valene (2nd from left, with her parents and Principal Mr Chan) from the Class of 2021 was one of the recipients of the PSC Scholarship. Valene shares more about this honour:

“It is a humbling experience to have been awarded the PSC scholarship. Rather than an achievement, I see the scholarship as both a commitment I have made to serve Singapore, and a way of expressing my gratitude to my family, teachers, and friends for their effort in shaping me into who I am today. The prospect of serving in multiple branches of the Public Service drives me to maximise my personal growth, so I can better value-add to the Service. It is with the same spirit that I go abroad to study Human, Social and Political Sciences at the University of Cambridge. I hope to contribute to the openness, diversity, and innovativeness of the public sector, and most importantly, caring for the needs of Singaporeans. To my juniors, there is much to be grateful for. Amid your academic studies, do make the time to give back to your community and seize opportunities for self-development. Challenge yourself to venture out of your comfort zone, for you grow the most during periods of adversity. All the best!”

The school wishes Valene all the best as she continues her journey as a Leader of Honour to serve the community for greater good. Congratulations to Valene, and to all her family and teachers who have played a role in guiding and developing her throughout her formative years.
