This is the teams’ first showing since 2019, due to the suspension of the competition during the pandemic. The teams have trained hard, remaining resilient despite the challenges brought about by COVID-19 and embracing the change involved in competing under the new virtual format.

Aeon, the leader of our Nursing Cadet team, shares her biggest takeaway from taking part in this year’s National First Aid Competition (NFAC).

“I would say that my biggest takeaway is the friendship forged with my team. Usually, we are hardly able to spend time together outside of routine CCA training. But ever since we started to train as a team for NFAC, we have forged a strong team dynamic. We understand that each of us is important to support the rest of the team and plays a clear and specific role.” – Aeon Lee, Nursing Cadet team

The teams would like to thank their SJB teachers-in-charge for supporting and walking alongside them in their journey to the National First Aid Competition, as well as their Y5, Y6 and alumni seniors for their dedicated mentorship and guidance every step of the way.

Well done to all our teams and we are very proud of them!
