第15届劲爆剧场大比拼在疫情的笼罩之下于2022年11月9日至11月11日圆满举行！今年的活动共吸引了来自13所不同学校的110名学生。与往年不同，这届的劲爆剧场首次在本地以线上线下混合形式进行。本次工作坊由澳门戏剧农庄行政总监兼劲爆剧场大比拼亚洲顾问李俊杰Jacky导师在线上授课，而同学们在德明政府中学汇集一堂，在线下与Jacky导师连线，并在负责老师们和协调员和的带领下在工作坊进行了为期三天的学习与实践。

劲爆剧场大比拼是通过各种游戏来让各队比拼即兴表演能力的比赛。它融合了剧场的戏剧性和体育运动的竞争性，让舞台活跃了起来，让观众也能参与其中。今年的比拼总共有15种游戏，供参赛队伍挑选在舞台上展开博弈。

同学们在前两天的工作坊中受益匪浅。来自德明政府中学的万馥菡同学表示：“劲爆剧场是一个很好的契机，让很多来自各个学校的学生共同交流，互相学习，结交同样喜欢戏剧的朋友。第一天早上的破冰游戏瞬间让教室里兴奋的气氛沸腾了，而游戏进行时的欢笑声鼓励着我们，让我们鼓起勇气突破自我。而到了第二天，我们都更放松了，肆意展示自己的充满奇思妙想的表演。在游戏环节中，我们有机会见识了各校同学的表演风格，同时锻炼了自己的应变能力与表现力，获益匪浅。例如学生们普遍觉得最难的“死亡游戏”，考察了学生的临场编剧能力以及表演的张力。”

工作坊的最后一天，令大家期待已久的劲爆剧场大比拼便展开了。8个由不同学校学生组成的队伍分别上台通过有趣的开场白介绍了各自的队伍。有的队伍给大家带来了刚柔并济的武术表演，有的跳起了流行舞蹈，还有的组呈现了幽默的小短剧，真的是各显神通！通过第一轮的比拼，“劲猫”组成功进入决赛，与协调员组成的“双十一”组展开了激烈的对垒，最终喜获总冠军。

三天的劲爆剧场使同学们不仅通过快乐有趣的方法学会戏剧知识和种种人生道理，也收获了满满的跨院校友谊，真是满载而归！

最后，再次祝贺第15届劲爆剧场大比拼圆满成功！感谢Jacky导师、各校负责老师、协调员和学员们的鼎力支持。我们明年再见！

The 15th Dunman High Inter-school Theatresports Championship 2022 was successfully held from 9-11 November 2022. This year’s edition attracted 110 participants from 13 different schools. Due to travel restrictions during this ongoing pandemic, our instructor, Jacky Li from Macau’s Theater Farmers, joined us virtually. With the assistance of teachers in-charge and facilitators, students had the opportunity to engage in enriching learning opportunities during the 3-day workshop.

Theatresports is an improvised theatre that incorporates the elements of sports competition. In this workshop, participants have learnt how to play 15 games in total, which trains them on improvising their play on-the-spot.

The first two days of theatresports indeed broadened the students’ horizons on theatre play. Wan Fuhan, a participant from Dunman High School explained, “Theatresports was an eye-opening opportunity for students from different schools to come together with a common love for drama, to learn together, and forge new friendships. On the first day, when playing the ice breaker games, the room was filled with screams of thrill, with eager students participating actively. The atmosphere really helped encourage us to step out of our comfort zones. On the second day, we had all already warmed up to each other, with everyone feeling much more comfortable to showcase their talents by incorporating them into their groups’ performing items. Through the different games, we were also exposed to the different performing styles of students from various schools, which really trained me to adapt and adopt the new performing techniques.”

On the last day of the workshop, the long-awaited Theatresports Championship has finally arrived! This year’s competition consists of 16 different games, participating groups can pick any of these games to compete against each other. These 8 participating groups formed by all the participants of different schools, took turns going on stage to perform a group component together to introduce their group. Some groups performed martial arts, with a great balance of grace and strength. Other groups also danced to popular songs, or performed funny and lighthearted skits. They were all creatively unique and really brought out the identity of each group! Through all the different rounds of competitions, “劲猫” group successfully enter the final round, going against the student facilitators: “双十一” group! After an intense battle, “劲猫”group surfaced as our champion of this year’s theatresports！

Once again, we would like to thank the students for making this year’s 15th Dunman High Inter-school Theatresports Championship a success! Also, extending our appreciation to Mr Jacky Li, teachers in-charge, student facilitators and all participants for their full support.

We are looking forward to seeing you again next year!
