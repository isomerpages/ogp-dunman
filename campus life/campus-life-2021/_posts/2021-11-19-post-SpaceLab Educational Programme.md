On 8 Nov, a team of DHS students from class 2I took part in the finals of the Space Lab, a space outreach programme co-organised by the Office for Space Technology and Industry (OSTIn) and the Ramon Foundation in Israel, in partnership with the Israel Space Agency (ISA). In the finals held over a virtual meeting platform, they had the privilege of presenting their research experiment to a panel of highly distinguished judges from Singapore, Israel and the United States including NASA astronaut Dr Garrett Reisman and NASA Ames Research Center Chief Scientist Dr Jacob Cohen.

Their research experiment focuses on the interaction between gallium nitrate and fibrinogen solution in space. Preliminary research shows that gallium nitrate can significantly decrease the amount of time taken for blood clotting processes to take place, and hence speed up wound healing for space travellers. This would then present a newer and more efficient way for wound healing, should any mishaps occur in space, and improve the overall safety of space travel.

The road to the finals was not easy. The team reached the finals through a rigorous selection process that consisted of a series of design reviews with classmates, teachers as well as expert judges. Being the finalist team representing Dunman High School, they carried out their experiments in the school’s science lab, as well as constantly improved their presentation resources. Even though their project was not chosen at the end of the day, the preparation processes, research and test-experiments done were all rewarding in their own way. It was a fruitful journey learning more about the research topic, the fun and fragility of experimental processes, and most importantly, experienced first hand, the resilience which scientific research requires.
