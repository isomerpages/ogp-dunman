Every year, Microsoft organises the Imagine Cup Junior competition to invite 13-18 year old students to change the world with technology. This year‚Äôs theme is ‚ÄúAI for Good‚Äù where students have to think innovatively about how to use AI to positively change the world. We are proud to announce that one of our DHS teams clinched the top 10 Singapore team Award. Our school would like to congratulate our award winners of a job well done in the 2021 Microsoft Imagine Cup Junior Singapore Competition.

The theme of the Microsoft Imagine Cup 2021 was AI for Good, which essentially meant using artificial intelligence to make the world a better place. Our team created an AI Triage System known as Detech. The system is meant to be implemented in disaster-stricken zones to help identify casualties as well as categorise them based on their injuries and how serious the injuries are. Detech will be implemented with a drone equipped with a camera that will be flown over the area impacted by natural disasters to scan for casualties. This system will help rescue workers save manpower and man-hours by helping them search and prioritize the casualties, separating those who require immediate medical attention from those whose injuries can wait for another time. Hence, our system helps provide speedy delivery of assistance relief during natural disasters.

_Individual Reflections_  
BEATRIX KOH XIU FANG (4D):  
The Microsoft Imagine Cup has allowed me to venture out of my comfort zone and learn more about how AI is incorporated into everyday life. We had the opportunity to delve into flaws of the current emergency healthcare system in places where natural disasters have become a common experience for those living there. I was able to explore AI and drone technology while gaining knowledge in the degrees of urgency in triage. World affairs and the healthcare industry has always been an interest of mine and I am glad that I was able to rethink and explore ways to improve lives around the world through AI aided technology. Unlike the other members of the team, I was not very involved in technology prior to the competition. Through this experience, I was able to explore machine learning and learn more about adaptable designing of products. The research we did also ignited my interest in emergency healthcare services and the importance of making healthcare services available for all and any country in the world. Overall, it was definitely a rewarding experience for me and I had a great time. üôÇ

BEN SZE HE YU (4F):  
The Microsoft Imagine Cup was a great experience and opportunity for me to apply various hardware technologies, such as drones, to artificial intelligence software. We were able to innovate and create our AI Triage System, in a unique way that allowed us to research and gain a deeper understanding into different kinds of machine learning. I have also learnt various approaches to designing technological products. I was able to apply the First Aid and triage knowledge I learnt from my Co-Curricular Activity, St John Brigade, to a real-world scenario, to help people in need and improve the current disaster response systems. Through this competition, I gained an insight to many other designs and applications of artificial intelligence by participants worldwide, giving me an exposure to the world of artificial intelligence. Overall, this competition was an invaluable learning experience, and provided me with the platform to learn and innovate.

LAM YIK TING (4D):  
Since young, I have always thought about how I can better help out with global issues and the Microsoft Imagine Cup gave me the platform and opportunity to do just that ‚Äì allowing me to innovate and provide assistance to those in need. Our team did some initial research on the various aspects of healthcare that we could help out in, before embarking on the idea of supporting victims of natural disasters. Our solution combines the software aspect, AI, with hardware ‚Äì a drone. As an Infocomm student, I could apply my technological expertise by exploring multiple algorithms such as K-Means, Logistic Regression, or Learning Vector Quantization and analyzing them through various perspectives to figure out the most accurate one for our use case. Furthermore, it was fun to see how we could incorporate the algorithms into our software and hardware for the most effective user experience. In conclusion, this project was very fulfilling and the competition was an excellent platform for me to brainstorm, ideate and apply various AI techniques to serve people in need.
