我校初中部同学在《全国中学编彩比赛》中低年组获得全国一等奖和深度报道奖！高年级组则获得了三等奖！全国中学生编采比赛由推广华文学习委员会、《联合早报》属下学生报《逗号》、新民中学和民情联系组（REACH）联合主办。

此次比赛，我们在努力采访和编写的五个月期间，非常感谢能得到身边的人的支持和大家的帮助，尤其是校长、老师、校友、家长会以及同学们的积极拉票和投票，让我们能够勇敢面对无数的困难，最终获得奖项。

我们通过比赛，不但吸取了有关于编彩的宝贵知识，还激发了我们在编彩时的创意思考。整个过程中，我们体验到编辑以及采访带来的乐趣，也进一步了解了编采的不易。为了找到最适合的题材，我们反复思考、拟题和进行多方面的资料搜寻后才开始写稿。准备采访的过程和聆听受访者的经验更让我们获益不浅。写作时，我们还须注意语言的客观性，并思考如何巧妙地将采访和调查资料融入报道中。最终，我们在思想火花的碰撞下，齐心协力，分工合作，成功地呈交了让我们引以为傲的作品。我们一定会百尺竿头更进一步，把得奖的荣誉当成新的起跑点，继续加油！

We are happy to share that our Lower Secondary Team clinched the First Prize and Best In-Depth Reporting Award, while our Upper Secondary Team clinched the Second Runner Up Prize in the 2021 Create Your Own Newspaper Competition. This contest is jointly organised by the Committee to Promote Chinese Language Learning, Singapore Press Holdings, Xinmin Secondary School and REACH. A compilation of all submitted articles will be given to the school after the competition. The team members would also like to extend their sincerest thanks to all staff, alumni, parents and Dunmanians for their enthusiastic votes and publicity for their work.

During the competition, we experienced the joy of writing and interviewing firsthand, while also understanding the hard work that goes behind the creation of a newspaper article. Although the process of crafting relevant questions for our interviewees was tedious, being able to engage and listen to the thoughts of our interviewees was worth the hard work. Another one of our biggest takeaways was the improvement in our writing skills as we aimed to present a concise and objective article. Working with our fellow team members has also made this experience more memorable and fulfilling. We will continue to strive to do better for upcoming competitions!

Lower Secondary Team – First Prize and Best In-Depth Reporting Award:  
Zhang Yiran (2E), Jin Yanxin (2F), Wong Yu Yan (2F), Koh Yue Han (2I), Tan Eason (2I)

Upper Secondary Team – Second Runner Up Prize:  
Kerrine Chua (4B), Janelle Tan (4E), Liu Jingxian (4I), Jason Edward Sjarif (4K), Huang Jianhao (3E)
