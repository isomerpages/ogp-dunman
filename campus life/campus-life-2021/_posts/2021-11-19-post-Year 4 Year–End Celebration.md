The Y4 Year-End Celebration took place on 29th October 2021. Even though there were COVID-19 restrictions in place, the event was still a memorable one for everyone with activities such as class games, performances and bubble tea. The activities conducted allowed everyone to bond with their classmates, reminisce about the 4 years in Junior High and create long lasting memories.

The celebration revolved around the storyline we left off from the Y1 Orientation in 2018 where we had just finished building our spaceship to take through our Dunman High journey. The theme for the Year-End Celebration was “Beyond Infinity”, which symbolizes that the Year 4 batch can push beyond limits and leave their own legacy as a confident trailblazer.

After a round of games such as Guess the Lyrics and Gartic Phone, we had performances from our very own batch mates ranging from singing to K-Pop dance covers.

At the finale, there was also a prize presentation ceremony for the top 3 best performing classes in the games. Throughout the event, there was maximum enthusiasm from the students as they actively participated and thoroughly enjoyed themselves one last time as a class.

We hope that all the year 4 students had a blast and will always hold this important day in their hearts! We wish you all the very best for the upcoming O-levels as well as life in Senior High.

To all the teachers who made this possible: Ms Zarifah, Mr Luo, Mr Han, Ms Joseph and Ms Heng, thank you very much for all your support and guidance throughout the whole planning and execution process!

中四的年终庆祝会在今年10月29日举行。虽然在筹办的过程中有各种疫情阻断措施的限制，庆祝会依然给我们留下了一生难忘的回忆。庆祝会当天有有趣的游戏，美味可口的珍珠奶茶供全年级的同学们享用以及一系列由我们中四同学精心准备的才艺表演例如钢琴演奏和优美的舞蹈。在表演开始之前，我们的年级主任也为我们致辞。

今年的年终庆祝会续集着2018年中一迎新会的主题：太空探险。我们把其中的飞船比喻成带领我们探索四年初中生活的工具。今年的庆祝会象征着初中探险旅程的结尾，而我们即将开启美好的高中探险旅程，呼应了2018年迎新会的主题。

年终庆祝会在多人盼望下终于开始了！首先，庆祝会包括猜歌迷和传话游戏，也有我们中四同学精心准备的表演；从唱歌到跳舞，充分展现了自己的才华！

庆祝会的最后一项节目便是颁奖典礼，给在游戏中表现最好的前三名班级颁发奖品。庆祝会的过程中，同学们都兴致勃勃，也十分积极地参与为他们所安排的节目。但我们相信他们尤为珍惜的是与全班同学和老师在一起的最后时光。

希望所有2021年中四的同学在年终庆祝会中与朋友们渡过了快乐以及难以忘怀的时光。在此祝愿各位同学在今年的高华O水准考试获得佳绩，也能在升上高中后继续散发光芒。

我们也非常感谢庆祝会的各位负责老师：Ms Zarifah, Mr Luo, Mr Han, Ms Joseph 和 Ms Heng。没有了你们的支持与指导，筹备过程以及庆祝会当天的活动就无法顺利地进行。谢谢你们！
