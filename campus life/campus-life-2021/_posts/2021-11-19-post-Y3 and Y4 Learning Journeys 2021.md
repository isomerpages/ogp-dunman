Not being able to travel overseas, we brought the world to our students instead! On 25th and 28th October, our Y3 students learnt more about the rich culture of our ASEAN neighbours Vietnam and Philipines. They had fun making parols, Filipino ornamental lanterns displayed during the Christmas season and interacted with passionate youths who were volunteering to make lives better for their respective communities.

On the 26th and 27th October, our Y4 students immersed themselves in the rich history and culture of China through a virtual session and learnt how to make traditional Chinese crafts. The programme also allowed them to had a brief but meaningful exchange with Chinese students.
