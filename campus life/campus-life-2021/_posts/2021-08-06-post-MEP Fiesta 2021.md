The MEP Fiesta was a year round festival of various Music-related activities open to the school and involving MEP students. There were Indian and Malay Music workshops held in April and August respectively for students to understand music of other cultures at a deeper level. Students also shared on compositional approaches in the annual SMASH workshop held on 25 August.

In concert performances, Year 6s rounded off their final year with a Farewell Recital on 19 August at library@esplanade online.

On 14 August, the Year 5s organised their 11th CRASH Concert online due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. To exercise leadership and develop their organisational skills, this year’s concert was led by i/c and MEP Scholarship recipient Tong Hsin-Hsiang (5C37) and his team consisting of MEP Scholarship recipients Kung Yen-Fay (5C11), Koh Mi Yo (5C22), Gabrielle Lau Qian Tong (5C37), Joshua Ng Chin Hsuen (5C37) with other Year 5 MEP students helping. This concert is a platform for students to showcase their talent and develop confidence in performing. The concert featured impressive solo performances with works by Liszt, Telemann and Scriabin and also works on the guzheng, clarinet and cello. The concert also featured External Y2 and 3 MEP students in performance. This year’s concert also premiered original compositions, including a work by Matthew Chan (4I) for string quartet. There was also a creative skit by the Y3 MEP students and a delightful arrangement of Queen’s Bohemian Rhapsody by the Y4 MEP students led by Kelly Chu (4K). The concert also featured a creative rendition of Ernst Toch’s Geographical Fugue performed by representatives of the different levels led by Tong Hsin-Hsiang (5C37). The concert ended with the traditional So Long, Farewell goodbyes.

Overall the concert was fun, engaging and well supported by a good crowd of families and friends of MEP students with a good online attendance and interaction. See you all again next year!

Personal reflection from Kung Yen Fay 5C11:

“In the face of challenges, the planning committee were resilient and adaptable, overcoming all challenges in their way. Thanks to the hard work and dedication of these 13 students, CRASH XI premiered successfully, with an audience of roughly 100. Organising and executing CRASH XI was definitely not an easy task, the runway leading up to the premiere of CRASH XI on the YouTube live was a nerve-wracking one as we were constantly doubting ourselves and anxious over the performance. Having to coordinate multiple levels of MEP students was one of the most difficult aspects of this journey. But through this journey, we learnt to be adaptable and resilient, learning from our mistakes instead of allowing them to dampen our spirits. With the continuous support of our encouraging teachers and classmates, we did not falter and continued working hard. We are so happy CRASH XI was a success!”
