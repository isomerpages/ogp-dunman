EIC 2021 is a national competition open to all secondary schools, junior colleges, Institute of Technical Education, and Institutes of Higher Learning. It aims to encourage students to embark on a journey of discovery through engineering. This year’s theme explores the application of ionising radiation in engineering.

Our Junior High team, S-30, comprising Jason Edward Sjarif, Samuel Neo Tuan Wen, Tit Shao En, and Yeoh Yu Zhi, achieved the stellar outcome of being crowned champions in the Secondary Category. For the final round of the competition, they designed a contactless, disposable mask sanitiser using UV radiation to address the concerns and unsustainable practice of using disposable masks on a daily basis.

Our Senior High teams also did well, with J-13, comprising Fu Xiang Tai Nigel, Ku Shang Chu, Lim Xin Xuan Jinelle, and Peh Qi Jie Jonathan overcoming the odds to become the 2nd runner up in the Junior College category.

Team J-12, consisting Bai Yifan, Wang Zilu, Wong Ching Whee, and Zhang Ruiyang, clinched the Merit Award in the same category.

While the competition has not been easy, requiring the investment of countless hours and the resilience to overcome intimidating obstacles, the teams gained much from the entire experience.

I was able to learn about many things regarding radiation that was not covered in the school curriculum, as well as exercise my creativity to integrate a hazardous energy into something that could solve a real world problem. It was a very fulfilling experience, working with peers who have same passion in science and technology as me. – Ku Shang Chu, Team J-13

Don’t be afraid to venture out of your comfort zone. Having a detailed plan such as key milestones checks and good teamwork is key to achieving stellar results for this project. Winning is just the icing on the cake as what the 4 of us would gain is learning from the challenges that we faced constantly throughout the project and the process of innovation. –     Tit Shao En, Team S-30
