In what ways can individuals play our part to address the Semakau landfill problem? In the finals of the Problem-X Challenge, jointly organised by The Gifted Education Branch, MOE and the Singapore University of Technology and Design, Our Dunmanians Ivie Poh Yong Qi (4F), Pok Yuen Xuan (4F) and Ho Xu Ying Nicole (4I) passionately shared that using stainless-steel cutlery instead of single-use bio-plastics alleviates the Semakau landfill problem and has a lower carbon footprint.

Congratulations Ivie, Yuen Xuan and Nicole! We are proud of your endeavours in social advocacy using science communication!
