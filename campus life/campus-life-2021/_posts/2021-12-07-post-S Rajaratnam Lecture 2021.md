On 30 November 2021, six students from Dunman High School had the privilege of physically attending the MFA Diplomatic Academy’s S Rajaratnam Lecture 2021 by Deputy Prime Minister and Coordinating Minister for Economic Policies, Mr Heng Swee Keat. The lecture was held at the NUS University Cultural Centre. We were privileged to be in attendance of the lecture which Deputy Prime Minister (DPM) Heng Swee Keat delivered. Some of our friends and tutors were also given the same privilege to watch the simulcast of the lecture from the comfort of the Humanities Room.

Launched in 2008, the lecture is part of the academy’s efforts to equip MFS officers and other Singapore public officials with the knowledge to understand and respond to an increasingly complex and fast-evolving external environment. The lecture, which has been a platform for distinguished speakers to speak on topics related to diplomacy and international relations, was also virtually screened on-site in school. Titled “Fostering Growth and Stability in an Age of Complexity”, the lecture shed light on how Singapore can continue to remain relevant amidst seismic global changes experienced today. Below are some key take-aways from the lecture.

**The Global Economy**  
Economic growth and interdependence serves as a force for global peace, providing the foundation of political stability internally and externally. In the age of globalisation, economic growth is no longer a zero-sum game. Instead, everyone benefits from the expansion of trade. Between countries, greater economic integration has broken down walls and encouraged greater and more efficient flows of capital and goods. There is also a significant increase in interpersonal exchanges and dissemination of ideas and technology, forging mutual understanding across countries which promotes global peace and stability.

However, this also means that new global challenges has arisen. Chief of which would be how some countries seem to perceive economic prosperity as a zero-sum game – where if a country wins, another is bound to lose. Whilst this cannot be further from the truth, many countries seem to have fallen into this myth. Other global challenges also include the Global Financial Crisis, to the more recent spread of COVID-19. As the countries become increasingly intertwined, this increases the economic and societal devastation resulting from the sheer extent of interconnectedness in the world today.

**US and China**  
As the two largest economies in the world, the US and China have naturally found themselves in a state of competition against each other. With differences in culture and political ideology, lines have been blurred between economic, ideological and technological domains, leaving little common ground for cooperation. However, much like that at the recent COP-26 in Glasgow regarding climate change, it is imperative for these two superpowers to reconcile and achieve a new equilibrium in the world, seeing as they are competing within the same interconnected and interdependent economic system. Doing so otherwise would lead to mutually assured economic destruction. They cannot let strategic mistrust overshadow opportunity for growth, and instead have safeguards to ensure that competition does not lead to conflict. They must even work together in some areas of global concern, such as the pertinent issue of climate change, given their ability and resources to make the most substantial change.

**Three ways Singapore can thrive in this age of increasing complexity**  
The lecture also shed important light on how Singapore, in spite of its small size, is able to contribute to the global economy. Firstly, Singapore can band together with other states with similar goals and with this collective force enact change on a greater scale than what we can do alone. Whilst small states may not have significant influence over the world stage, we are inevitably affected by these global factors. As such, we must establish a more multilateral system, whereby the sovereignty of each country is respected regardless of size. We can do this through greater participation in multilateral organisations, and voicing out the interests of smaller states. In fact Singapore has already been shown to be able to make a difference in areas such as global trade, with the establishment of the Trans-pacific Strategic Economic Partnership Agreement. Furthermore with the added growth of digital trade, this only creates more opportunities for smaller states to grow.

Secondly, Singapore needs to ensure ASEAN as a whole will prosper in the long-run. ASEAN is the fifth largest economy globally, and as one of its ten participating countries, Singapore has much to reap when ASEAN is successful. Whilst there may sometimes be disagreements within the organisation, ASEAN should continue to keep the bigger picture in mind, and cooperate to remain open and inclusive.

Finally, Singapore has to continually adapt to globalisation, and find more ways to prosper in this increasingly flattened global landscape. As an open economy Singapore has benefited greatly from globalisation, but there have been opposing sentiments as these benefits have not been equally spread out amongst Singapore. Workers have experienced wage stagnation and intense competition, with the pandemic only fanning the discontentment felt by Singaporeans. In order to pursue the benefits of globalisation in the long-run, we must maintain continual improvement of Singaporean’s lives. To do this we must transform our economies and workplaces to better suit the global environment.

**Personal Takeaways**  
Singapore is heavily dependent on global factors, and as students we must keep an open mind, and broaden our viewpoints beyond the Singaporean context. This lets us better understand and adapt to changes in the global economy as future representatives of Singapore. This is also to better embody Singapore’s creed of multiculturalism, where we embrace diversity and enrich our way of life. Therefore we must find common ground with like-minded countries for cooperation, so that we can carry these values into the future.

To remain competitive and relevant, we can no longer compete based on low-cost. Instead, we must uphold the rule of law to ensure trust from investors, maintain agreements with our partners and provide quality education for our people. While opening up our economy to globalisation may result in internal disruption of jobs, it allows stimulation of competition. We must hence restructure our economic system to ensure that our own people’s jobs are safeguarded while advocating against fragmentation.
