In Dunman High, the Yutaka Japanese Cultural Club hosts annual exchange programmes with students from Shibuya Senior High School and Makuhari Senior High School. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the programme can only be kept online. Teachers and students from all participating schools came together to prepare and hold a virtual programme via Zoom on 17 November 2021.

We kicked off the session with a short opening address from Casey Yuen (5C45) from Dunman High, Toru Ichinose from Shibuya Senior High and Riko Mizoguchi from Makuhari Senior High. Teachers present also expressed their eagerness to proceed with the activities planned. Prior to the programme, corporate videos and virtual tours from each school were shared with one another, allowing the students to learn more about the schooling culture in different countries.

We then started with a short presentation conducted by Dunman High students, illustrating the Singapore culture, sharing about characteristics of Singaporeans such as our use of Singlish, as well as attractions found in Singapore which we hope the Japanese students will be able to visit in the near future. Afterwards, students broke off into breakout rooms. Within these groups, they had in-depth discussions about their experiences in school, exchanging stories within their own schools as well as how they are coping with the global pandemic. Students also talked about their own interests, and were able to find other students with similar interests, allowing them to know one another better. Moving on, facilitators from Shibuya Senior High opened up the topic of climate change. Students shared meaningful insights with one another regarding the topic, as well as what each country has done to tackle this issue. All of these taught us the importance of tackling climate change so as to prevent the negative impacts of it.

The session ended with student representatives of each school giving a short closing address, expressing their gratitude for the engaging and enjoyable programme despite it being restricted to online means.

I was able to take away many things from this experience. It gave me a better understanding of the culture in Japan, how different the school systems are, as well as how different our daily lives are. By planning for this event, it taught me the rigour and effort behind every event organized by others. I was able to experience the process firsthand, whether it is administrative matters or brainstorming ideas for the activities. Furthermore, it also taught me how to adapt to an unfavourable situation. We were unable to carry out our original activity due to connectivity issues to certain websites, but we were able to improvise on the spot and try other activities to keep the session engaging. I feel that being able to react swiftly to issues allowed the session to continue smoothly and was crucial to the success of the programme.

To wrap up, all students expressed their enjoyment and hope for future programmes with one another. It was certainly a meaningful and memorable experience, and the exchange programme this year was definitely a huge success.
