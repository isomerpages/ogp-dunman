From 15th to 19th November, Year 4 Bicultural Studies Programme (BSP) students participated in the 2021 Beyond the Classroom Programme (BCP) with the aim of deepening their understanding of different cultures and developing their cultural intelligence.

Through a series of workshops, virtual tours and a virtual student exchange, we were engaged in a variety of cultural experiences. Through the workshops led by arts professionals and practitioners, we were exposed to various aspects of American culture, such as American films, roots music, literature, drama and dance, namely Jive and Hip Hop. Through a rich combination of short lectures, discussions and hands-on sessions, we learnt the origins of these art forms, and what they revealed about the complexities and layers of American culture and society. We also gained a better understanding of how the arts have been influenced by the development of technology, and the impact of American culture on the rest of the world. Although these workshops were conducted over Zoom, we had an enjoyable time with the quizzes and breakout discussions. We also had a hands-on experience learning Jive moves and Hip Hop dance steps with the guidance of our dance instructors. (The moves looked easy, but they were not!) In the drama workshop, we had a segment where we role-played and read the lines of an American play as a precursor to our discussion of the experiences of the characters. In the literature workshop, we wrote short stories that helped us appreciate better the aspirations and anxieties of Americans and their American Dream.

On top of all that, we took a virtual trip to Xi’an to see various cultural artefacts, such as the Terracotta Warriors, and learn more about local cuisine, for example the famous biang biang noodles. Speakers from Chinese technology enterprises also shared with us the latest technological advances in the drone and artificial intelligence sectors in China, and gave us an opportunity to learn basic computer programming in Chinese.

One of the highlights of the programme was a virtual exchange with students from Tauhara College in New Zealand on the last day. We had student representatives from both sides share about their respective countries and school life. Following that, we had an enjoyable time interacting with the New Zealand students in breakout rooms. Through this experience, we reflected on the commonalities and differences between the overseas students and us. This made us reflect more deeply on what we could learn from their positive practices for our own development.

During the programme, the Year 4 BSP students were also split into groups to do a collaborative inquiry project on the various regions in the United States, such as the South, Southern California, the Pacific Northwest, the Northeast and the Appalachia. Even though we did not get to travel to the United States, the inquiry task helped us gain deep insights into American society and culture.

Overall, we all had a very fruitful time learning about American culture and society, life in New Zealand, and developments in China through the carefully thought-out programme planned by our teachers. Even though it was held online, the BCP this year was still packed with activities that gave us a full experience as if we really did visit America itself in the span of a week. What a journey!

今年十一月的放眼世界、学贯中西活动 （Beyond the Classroom Programme）使我们对于西方文化有了更深的了解。虽然无法真正到西方国家浸濡，但为期五天的活动让我们可以从多方面感受西方文化的魅力。

活动之前，很多同学对美国的认识仅局限于美国是非常自由，文化很多元的发达资本主义国家。通过BCP活动，我们对美国与西方文化（包括它的历史、音乐、舞蹈、电影、戏剧、文学等）有了更全面的认知。美国音乐的工作坊让我们看到了不同文化的碰撞与科技经济的进步所孕育出的美国音乐——爵士音乐、摇滚音乐、R&B音乐、巴萨诺瓦音乐等，同时也让我们意识到美国在音乐领域对世界的影响。捷舞与嘻哈舞的工作坊则让我们通过亲身体验了解美国交谊舞与街舞文化的起源与兴起，加深了我们对美国文化的理解与欣赏。电影与戏剧的作坊使我们了解美国电影与戏剧的变迁与美国的软实力。电影与戏剧不仅是一种娱乐，其所揭示的社会文化更是促进文化多样性，让人们对文化有更深了解的平台。美国文学的作坊让我们通过一些关于美国梦、美国附会与贫困的短篇小说与图片探索美国人的价值观、身份与文化。另外，我们也通过研究美国不同地区的历史、经济、政治与文化认识到这些地区丰富而又复杂的社会文化， 了解这些不同地区对于美国社会发展的贡献，从而对美国有更全面的认知。与纽西兰学生的交流可谓是其次活动最大的亮点。它让我们体验到西方人的热情，自信，敢于表达，并将此对比于东方文化的含蓄，了解不同文化的的优势，同时吸取不同文化的长处。在了解西方文化的同时，我们也虚拟参观了西安与一个中国科技企业。这个虚拟的中国之旅加深我们对于中国及其文化与科技的了解。

总之，这短短的五天之旅让我们受益颇多。虽然疫情使我们无法出国浸濡，但这个活动在一定程度上弥补了这个遗憾，让我们得以通过生动有趣的方式理解并欣赏美国社会与文化并从中思考它与中华文化之间的异同之处。
