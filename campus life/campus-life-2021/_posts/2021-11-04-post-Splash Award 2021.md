Every year, the Student Chapter of the Singapore Computer Society (SCS) organizes the Splash Awards which brings together students from secondary schools and post-secondary institutions including Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) to compete with their ingenuity and develop creative solutions that address the competition theme. This year’s theme is “How will Digital Intelligence & Cloud transform Singapore in a Post-Pandemic World?” where students are challenged to develop ideas and utilise cloud technologies and smart digital tools to create impactful solutions. We are proud to announce that two of our DHS teams clinched the Champion (Pre-tertiary category) and Cybersecurity category prizes respectively.

Our school would like to congratulate our award winners for a job well done in Splash Awards 2021!

_Champion Team Synopsis and Reflections_  
For Splash Awards 2021, our team developed a digital health solution called VisionPal to help ensure eye patients in Singapore can continue to receive high quality care for their eye conditions in the safety and convenience of their homes, even as Singapore moves towards the post-pandemic world. Essentially, VisionPal allows patients to monitor and conduct eye tests on their own. It will also analyze and alert them if any worsening of vision is found, so that they can seek early treatment and follow-up consultations with doctors. VisionPal complements the shift towards telehealth to help Singapore reduce COVID-19 transmission rates, meet eye patients’ demands, and ease workloads at hospitals and clinics.

Participating in Splash Awards 2021 with my team-mates Collette and Ray Teng has been a very fulfilling journey! The idea behind our mobile app comes from our grandparents as they suffer from various chronic eye diseases and we hope to help them by using technology. The competition spanned about 3 months including research, prototyping and final presentation. I am glad we managed to improve our solution at each competition stage given the tight timelines. I was able to apply my knowledge of iOS coding learnt through past experiences, such as the Swift Accelerator Program, to develop the mobile app. I also had fun experimenting with new frameworks which were previously unfamiliar to me. Lastly, I am very thankful for the guidance from our teacher mentors throughout the competition.

KOH RAY TENG (2I):  
Splash Awards 2021 was a very enriching experience for me as I did not manage to get through the first round when I competed in 2020. I am very thrilled to have achieved first place for Splash Awards this year. I had a lot of fun working on this competition with my fellow group mates, Collette and Min Jia. I learnt more about the importance of teamwork and that infocomm is not only about coding, but rather it has many other components, for example: AI. I also got to see the many different ideas the other teams had despite all of us being given the same criteria and theme. The ideas proposed were all very interesting and eye opening. All in all, Splash Awards 2021 is very memorable for me and I will work harder for the rest of the competitions I take part in in the future.

PHUA LI WEN COLLETTE (2I):  
Splash Awards 2021 has been an especially enriching learning experience for me. I have gained insights regarding cybersecurity, having done extensive research on data encryption and cloud storage. Moreover, the soft skills that I picked up along the way have been invaluable as well. Splash Awards 2021 has highlighted the importance of time management and teamwork. Amidst the increasing academic workload due to the upcoming examinations, I still had to set aside time to prepare for the finals. Thankfully, with the support of my teammates, we managed to pull through these challenges together. The workload was delegated according to each member’s strengths, and we helped each other out, which sped up the entire process and made it less stressful. In retrospect, Splash Awards 2021 has made me realize the applications of computational thinking and programming in the real-world context, and this has spurred me to continue pursuing my interest in coding.

_Cybersecurity sub-theme Team Winner Synopsis and Reflections_  
We designed our own e-commerce platform, SafeShop, with multiple scam protection features in order to combat the issue of rising scams due to more online shopping due to COVID-19. For example, we used AI to scan all the listings on our website to verify if it is a scam or not, before displaying symbols on them to allow users to differentiate between possible scam listings and verified listings. We also used AI to scan transactions and check for potentially fraudulent ones. If one is detected, we will take security actions such as locking the account to prevent further transactions. We will also store all verified transaction data using blockchain to ensure its security.

SAW ZE DONG (3K):  
Through Splash Awards, it is insightful to be able to see how COVID-19 has direct and indirect impact on online shopping, such as online scams, which prey on the vulnerability of those less familiar with newer technologies. Through this opportunity to develop and pitch my ideas to help resolve this issue, I was able to learn more and contribute to the increased cybersecurity of this segment of the community, which has been a truly inspiring experience. It allowed me to develop both hard and soft skills, such as prototyping and debugging and allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of how all of our sectors have to work together to keep us all safe in a post-pandemic world.

OON ZHENG KANG (3I):  
This Splash Awards journey was challenging yet fulfilling and enlightening. Throughout the process of coming up with the idea, creating the prototype and doing the actual presentation, my team and I faced many setbacks and challenges. However, it is through these challenges that I was able to understand the importance of resilience and perseverance, as well as the ability to understand one’s strengths and weaknesses. Through this competition, I was able to develop these skills, as well as better understand the immense importance of preventing scams from taking place, and expand my knowledge on e-commerce scams and website creation.
