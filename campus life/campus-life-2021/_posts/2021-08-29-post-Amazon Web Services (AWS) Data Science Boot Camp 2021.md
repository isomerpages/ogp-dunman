During the first week of the June holidays, 5 Dunmanians attended the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Data Science Boot Camp and competed in the AWS DeepRacer League at the end of the Boot Camp. We are proud to announce that our DHS team clinched 4th place out of 48 teams in the DeepRacer League competition.

The AWS Data Science Boot Camp is an introductory programme that teaches students about Python Programming and Deep Learning through programming the AWS DeepRacer – an autonomous self-driving model car. Participants had to attend over 22 hours of online courses before finally programming their self-driving car to compete in the DeepRacer League.

Our school would like to congratulate our award winners of a job well done in the 2021 AWS Data Science Boot Camp/DeepRacer League.

Participants’ Reflections

Ng Yu Siang Jayden (2B):

_During the June holidays, I joined the AWS Boot Camp 2021. It was a six day course. During the first 3 days, we went over the basics of computing in a crash course. As I was not too fluent in Python coding, this aided me a lot by strengthening my understanding of the basics. On the fourth day, the instructors taught us the methods we would be using to train our car. Using what my teammates and I have learnt over the past few days to the best of our abilities, we managed to climb the rankings and emerge as the fourth team. My teammates and I were overjoyed. Overall, I had a fruitful experience learning many new things. The Boot Camp also allowed me to bond with some of my schoolmates more, and heightened my interest in computing._

Lim Yee Zhi (2D):

_For this Boot Camp that I went for, I have learnt that it takes a lot of time and effort for AI and machines to become as smart and clever as the machines and AI that we see today in the world. I have also gained an insight as to how AIs are trained, by putting the machines through simulations and giving it rewards to encourage it to do certain tasks, such as staying on a track of a road. The results do not come easy and a lot of effort will have to be put in to make the machine smart. Lastly, from this Boot Camp, I have learnt how coding and machine learning is important in the future. We, as future leaders of the world, will need to be able to harness the power of technology so that we can be innovative and solve real world problems and make society one where it is super-efficient and can solve problems easily._

Wong Jun Xiang (2F):

_Singapore is progressing to be a SMART nation, and I strongly believe that this Boot Camp was able to imbue us with skills necessary to achieve such goals. During this Amazon Web Services Boot Camp, we were able to strengthen our knowledge in computing and learn about cloud computing. We were also exposed to machine learning, a new and ever evolving technology that has been the topic of much research in this era. Throughout this Boot Camp, I had made a few new friends and got to see my group’s model race against other schools, which was really fun. All in all, this experience was an enriching one and I hope more of such opportunities appear soon._

Foo Toon Kiat, Keith (2G):

_It was a week-long online workshop on the advanced part of coding and applying it in real-life. In this competition, I learnt about applying code to objects around us, for this case, model cars. Everyone was tasked to work as a group to configure the code in the model car, such that the car can complete the race course in the fastest time. After we spent time programming and making the online virtual car, we submitted the copy to the organizers. The organizers showcased all the cars in an online virtual racing competition where the fastest car wins. Our group’s car won 4th place out of 48 teams. It was indeed an accomplishment and a milestone for us. I look forward to pursuing more meaningful competitions like this and gain more experience._
