We are proud to share that three of our Dunmanians Vicky Ang Xin En (4F), Lim Zhi Yan (4I) and Woon Zee Ning (4I) represented Dunman High School and Singapore, and achieved the Consolation Prize (Physical Sciences category) in the recent ASEAN Science Project Competition organised by Ministry of Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation, Thailand.

As part of the Science Mentorship Programme under Professor Hu Jiangyong and Dr Tony Lim from NUS, the Dunmanians investigated how acid-activated biochar from wood chips was effective in removing both toxic metals and pharmaceutical pollutant such as Ibuprofen from wastewater over the course of one year. Dunman High School is grateful to partner with the NUS Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering over the past few years to nurture our science talents in programmes from both our Junior High STEAM Academy and the Senior High STEAM Collective.

Congratulations Vicky, Zhi Yan and Zee Ning! We are sure you have learnt a lot from this experience!
