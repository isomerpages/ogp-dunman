第14届劲爆剧场大比拼时隔两年，在疫情的种种考验下终于回归并圆满举行！今年的活动时长两天，于2021年11月23至24日举行。今年一共有9所学校，71名同学参加。值得提到的是，这是劲爆剧场首次在本地以线上Zoom工作坊的形式进行的。本次工作坊由澳门戏剧农庄行政总监兼劲爆剧场大比拼亚洲顾问李俊杰Jacky导师主持。

 劲爆剧场大比拼是一种融入了体育竞技元素的即兴剧场戏剧。由于参赛者都置身于家中，本次活动融入了更多能让同学们利用口头进行交流的元素。因此，参赛者需要在体验各种游戏时和他人沟通交流。时长两天的工作坊教授了8种游戏，使学员们更具倾听、口语发音和批判性思考等必备能力。而这些技能都能在我们的日常生活中有所用途。

在这些精彩的游戏中，新推出的 “押韵” 游戏获得了最多学员的喜爱。这个简单易懂，却考验创意、节奏及语感的游戏让各个学员都跃跃欲试，大显文艺才华。当然，具有更多故事性的游戏，如 “不能说的秘密” 及“ 三字经” 的人气度也非常高。学员们借此类游戏也学会了更加注重自己的表达方式和用词，并懂得了灵机应变的重要性。

在工作坊中，学生协调员必不可少。他们能够根据各自小组所需，自由灵活地开展各项活动。虽然一些学员们开始较为腼腆，但在老师和协调员们的鼓励下，他们都渐渐地“玩”开了。

本届劲爆剧场获得了各校的老师和同学们的一致好评。此项活动的圆满成功当然需归功于四组人的共同努力。首先要感谢Jacky老师给大家准备了丰富多彩的网上活动，并带领大家玩转游戏，领悟其中的道理。其次是各校的负责老师。他们帮忙安排活动与照顾大家，从而确保活动流畅，学员体验极佳。接着，协调员们也帮助并鼓励了学员们大胆挑战自我，尽心玩耍。最后我们也要把掌声送给学员们。他们非常配合，积极地参与活动，为劲爆剧场增添了不少活力与色彩。感谢各位的付出！

在此，我们祝贺第1４届劲爆剧场大比拼圆满成功！疫情漫漫其修远兮，但我们对戏剧表演和交流学习的热爱之火却永不熄灭。不管是线上还是线下，希望我们明年再见！

The 14th National Theatresports e-Workshop 2021 was successfully held from 23-24 November 2021. This year’s edition attracted 71 participants from 9 different schools. In face of the pandemic, Theatresports 2021 was held online for the first time. The workshop was conducted by Jacky Li, the Executive Director of Macau Theatre Farm and the Advisor of the Theatresports Competition in Asia.

Theatresports is an improvised theatre that incorporates the elements of sports. However, in view that all participants are attending the workshop from home, games were curated to place more emphasis on oral communication. Participants were required to communicate with each other during the games. In this 2-day workshop, we  learnt how to play a total of 8 games. These games have taught us fundamental skills such as listening, pronunciation and critical thinking. Application of such skills also remains relevant to our daily lives.

Amongst all these exciting games, the newly introduced “Rhyming” game was the most popular among the participants. The rules of this game may be easy to understand, yet the strategies to win the game definitely puts one’s creativity and rhythmic abilities to the test. Despite this, many remain eager and challenge themselves to come up with the best strategy to win the game. Not forgetting the story based games such as “The Secret ” and “3 words at a time” which were also well received by participants. Through these games, participants learnt to be more aware of their choice of words and how they express themselves. They were also able to hone their improvisation skills which was surely another valuable takeaway!

During this 2-day workshop, student facilitators played an important role in facilitating the various games. Amidst the facilitation, they were entrusted with the freedom to organise games and icebreakers that were deemed suitable for their respective group. Although participants were initially shy and reserved, heartwarming encouragement from teachers and the student facilitators enabled participants to ease themselves and actively participate in the activities.

This year’s workshop had been well received by fellow teachers and participants. Theatresports 2021 would not have been this successful if not for these four groups of people: Mr Jacky Li, for curating engaging games for us to play online and providing us with meaningful insights; the teachers-in-charge of all schools, for seeing us through the 2-days of workshop; student facilitators who took care of the various teams and encouraging them to participate; and not forgetting the participants who participated actively, bringing live and joy to this workshop. Thank you for all the hard work and dedication put into this workshop!

Although the pandemic may be far from over, our passion for Theatresports and hunger for learning shall never cease. We hope to see you next year!
