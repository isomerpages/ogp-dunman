2021年的中秋庆祝活动主题为“城里的月光”，语特理事会和双文化理事会延续去年的形式，举办了网上庆祝。

中秋节开幕前，中一的同学就开始参加黏土设计比赛，将优秀作品呈现在校园内；食堂的走廊上贴了灯谜，让同学和老师玩起中秋传统猜谜语的游戏；此外，学校各团体和个人也纷纷报名参加了“城里的月光”MV大赛，优秀作品剪接成一首优美动听的MTV，打造了浓郁节日气氛。

9月17日（周五）, 刘德荣校长的网上演讲拉开了中秋庆祝的帷幕，5C12班的周佳铃同学用琵琶独奏《月亮代表我的心》，如泣如诉地表达中秋的思念之情，组合版MV“城里的月光”打动了每一位德明人的心。疫情之下，我们已有一年多无法走出国门，但是却能腾出更多时间陪伴家人和朋友。明亮的月光代表着希望，能为我们照亮前方的路，带领我们渡过这非常时期。

最后，中二的同学们在中三语特学长们的带领下玩起了神秘又刺激的中秋密室逃脱游戏，为2021年的中秋节画上了完美的句号。

The theme for our 2021 Mid-Autumn Festival celebration was “Moonlight In The City”. The Chinese Language Elective Programme (CLEP) Council and the Bicultural Studies Programme (BSP) Council adopted a hybrid format for this year’s celebration due to the COVID-19 situation.

Before the event, the organising committee held a myriad of exciting activities. They were the Y1 Clay Design Competition, Riddle Game and the Music Video (MV) Competition, “Moonlight In The City”. The well-designed clay sculptures were displayed outside the Auditorium throughout the duration of the festival. In addition, the MVs were incorporated into a new version. The school’s campus was filled with a festive atmosphere.

An online opening ceremony was broadcast via YouTube video on 17 September 2021, Friday. Our Principal Mr. Tony Low delivered a speech during the morning assembly. Ms Mevi Mervana Tjioe Jia Ling from 5C12 then performed a Pipa Solo of the song “The Moon Represents My Heart”. A remix of the MV “Moonlight In The City” which showcased the efforts of all participants. It was an opportunity for us to gather as one Dunmanian family to enjoy the delectable mooncakes and admire the full moon!

Last but not least, the Y3 CLEP Council hosted online Escape Rooms for all Y2 students during Appreciation of Chinese Culture lessons. This fascinating game brought about a meaningful and fun ending to conclude our Mid-Autumn Festival Celebrations in 2021. We are grateful to all participants who made this a memorable event.
