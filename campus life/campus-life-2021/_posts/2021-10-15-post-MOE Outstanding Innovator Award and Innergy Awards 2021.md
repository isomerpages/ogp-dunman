This year, 11 teachers across Singapore received the MOE Outstanding Innovator Award, which recognises individuals who have been key influencers of innovation in their workplaces or beyond. We are proud to share that Mr Lee Seng Lee, HOD/Knowledge Skills & Talent Development, from our school is one of them! Mr Lee has been instrumental in leading the shift to embrace principles of the Parallel Curriculum Model in the Dunman High Programme.

The team behind the redesign of the Dunman High Programme curriculum were also honoured with the MOE Innergy Awards! This award recognises individuals/teams for successfully developing and implementing innovations to bring about significant benefits and impact. We are pleased to share that “DHP Curriculum (Re)design – Divergence for Convergence” is a winning project for 2021 and was recognised with a Silver award. The hope of the curriculum redesign is to nurture Dunmanians to be future ready, to adapt to the changing landscape, and to seize and create opportunities to make a difference to those whom they care about, whom they are serving and leading.

Congratulations to Mr Lee and the curriculum redesign team!
