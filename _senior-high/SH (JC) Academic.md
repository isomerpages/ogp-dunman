## MOE Programmes in DHS

The Music Elective Programme (MEP) provides opportunities for musically-inclined students to pursue a deeper and more comprehensive study in the subject. The MEP curriculum aims to develop students’ conceptual and analytical thinking and creativity through Performance, Music Analysis, Aural Perception and Composition.

#### **Bicultural Studies Programme (BSP)**
The Bicultural Studies Programme (BSP) has been offered by the Ministry of Education (MOE) since 2007 to develop bicultural and bilingual talents who can effectively interact with China and the West, and to further cultivate their interest and capacity to engage in key issues relating to contemporary China with cross-cultural perspectives. Students under the BSP who show strong academic performance and excellent personal qualities will be awarded the BSP Scholarship by MOE. Interested students may apply for this scholarship in JC1 when the application window opens at the start of the year. Only Singapore Citizens will be considered for this scholarship.

#### **Chinese Language Elective Programme (CLEP)**

The Chinese Language Elective Programme (CLEP) was introduced by the Ministry of Education in 1990 to nurture the language talent of students who have an aptitude for the Chinese language so that they can attain a high level of proficiency and enhance their understanding and appreciation of Chinese literature. The programme also aims to develop academically able students to become effectively bilingual so as to better serve the needs of our nation.

The CLEP is suitable for students with very strong passion and interest in Chinese Language, literature and culture, and who possess a high level of aptitude and academic ability in these areas of study. It provides a wide range of activities to enhance students’ learning, including literary lecture series, cultural camp, creative writing for publication in literary magazines, immersion trip to China or Taiwan, internship at Singapore Press Holdings, Mediacorp or National University of Singapore, and school-based projects.
