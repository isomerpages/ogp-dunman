#### **Chinese Language Elective Programme (CLEP)**

The Chinese Language Elective Programme (CLEP) was introduced by the Ministry of Education in 1990 to nurture the language talent of students who have an aptitude for the Chinese language so that they can attain a high level of proficiency and enhance their understanding and appreciation of Chinese literature. The programme also aims to develop academically able students to become effectively bilingual so as to better serve the needs of our nation.

The CLEP is suitable for students with very strong passion and interest in Chinese Language, literature and culture, and who possess a high level of aptitude and academic ability in these areas of study. It provides a wide range of activities to enhance students’ learning, including literary lecture series, cultural camp, creative writing for publication in literary magazines, immersion trip to China or Taiwan, internship at Singapore Press Holdings, Mediacorp or National University of Singapore, and school-based projects.
