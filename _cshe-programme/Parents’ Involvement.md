In Dunman High, we recognise that parents play an important and irreplaceable role in the holistic education of the children. As such, we involve parents in a number of our programmes and organise an engagement session with the universities for the parents.

Parents who are happy to partner the school in our CSHE Programme may email us at cshe@dhs.sg.

**(a) CSHE Day**

Parents are invited to participate in the CSHE Exhibition Fair. During the fair, parents may interact with representatives from universities and scholarship providers to gain updated information so as to better support their children in preparing for the various educational and career opportunities.
