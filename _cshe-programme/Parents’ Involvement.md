In Dunman High, we recognise that parents play an important and irreplaceable role in the holistic education of the children. As such, we involve parents in a number of our programmes and organise an engagement session with the universities for the parents.

Parents who are happy to partner the school in our CSHE Programme may email us at cshe@dhs.sg.

**(a) CSHE Day**

Parents are invited to participate in the CSHE Exhibition Fair. During the fair, parents may interact with representatives from universities and scholarship providers to gain updated information so as to better support their children in preparing for the various educational and career opportunities.


**(b) Involving Parents in Career Guidance Programme**

We invite parents to share their professional experiences or offer job-shadowing or work attachment opportunities for our students.


**(c) Connecting the Dots, Strengthening the Partnership: Preparing Dunmanians for Life Beyond**

This is a biannual session specially organised for our parents to engage the representatives from the 6 local universities in a Question-and-Answer session, so that parents may understand more about local university landscape, programme and application matters.
