As the education landscape expands and evolves, students are offered myriad options and possibilities for their future ahead. The Careers, Scholarships and Higher Education (CSHE) Programme prepares our students to make well-informed decisions on their future options that best match their interests, strengths and aspirations.

The CSHE programme is anchored in an EDGE framework that spells out the student outcomes that we aspire to develop in each Dunmanian across all the domains during his or her journey in Dunman High. The outcomes are developmental and reinforced through every stage of a Dunmanian’s education. It is also grounded in the school’s vision for each Dunmanian to be lifelong learners and Leaders of Honour.

**The EDGE framework comprises four stages: Excellence, Drive, Growth, Empowerment.**

Every Dunmanian strives to be the best that he/she can be. He/She possesses drive and embraces a growth mindset. He/She is an active contributor who takes an active role in bettering the lives of others in society.

The diversity affirms that every student who is willing to work hard and possesses the altruism to serve can succeed. With a well-considered decision on their scholarship and university, our students are empowered to become accomplished Dunmanians, scale higher peaks of excellence in life and make significant contributions to the society as Leaders of Honour.
