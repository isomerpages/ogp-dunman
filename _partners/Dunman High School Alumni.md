Dunman High School Alumni was formed on 16th July 1985 with the following objectives:

*   Promote close ties among alumni
*   Promote the educational goals of the Alumni to serve the country and society
*   Organise social and sports activities for members, take care of member welfare to build a better and more meaningful life for fellow alumni

The executive committee is currently led by President Mr Teo Kek Yeng. The association organises activities for its members as well as supports the school’s many initiatives.

In 2009, the Dunman High School Youth Alumni was established to build a network among newly graduated Dunmanians, and provide an avenue for contributing back to their alma mater. Since its inauguration, the Youth Alumni has held annual gatherings, community projects and sports activities for her members, as well as career and college application seminars for the pre-university students in school. In 2010 the Youth Alumni expanded its reach to include overseas branches in China, the United Kingdom and the United States of America.

德明政府中学校友会于1985年7月16日成立，宗旨为：

*   促进校友间之紧密联系
*   促进校友会之教育目标，从而为国家与社会服务
*   为会员举办各类社交与体育活动，照顾会员福利，从而建立更美好更有意义之生活

现任理事会由张克荣会长带领，为校友会筹办了一系列的活动。校友会也回馈母校，出钱出力支持学校的各项活动。

德明政府中学校友会青年团成立于2009年，力图为刚毕业的青年德明人建立起强大的联络网，并使青年团同学与母校保持紧密联系。自创办以来，青年团每年为成员们组织大型聚会、社区活动以及运动比赛等，同时担负辅导在校学弟学妹的重任，举办关于大学申请、职业规划的讲座。在2010年，青年团继续扩大团体网络范围，在中国、英国和美国设立分支会，并为当地的校友举行各类聚会与活动。
