The School Advisory Committee (SAC) comprises leaders of Singapore’s industrial and commercial sectors. They navigate the business world with skill and finesse, investing in local and overseas markets, and pioneered many unique enterprises in the process. Being truly global citizens who are rooted to Singapore, they not only excel on the global stage, but also contribute immensely to various charity work, nation building and cultural education in Singapore.

Members of the SAC are deeply concerned with the development of the school, sparing no efforts to provide assistance and support for the various school events and celebrations. The contributions of the SAC include:

*   Fundraising: Fundraising activities are organised to fund the promotion and implementation of various school initiatives.
*   Seminars: Successful entrepreneurs and experts from various professions are invited to deliver keynote speeches in the school, expanding the horizon and inspiring the “entrepreneurial dare” of our students.
*   Industry attachment programme: Organisations which are willing to provide attachment opportunities are sourced and contacted by the SAC members, who also provide teachers and students with opportunities to intern at their organisations or factories.
*   Awards and bursaries: Staff and students are selected by the SAC for various awards, including Long Service Award, Most Creative Teacher Award, Model Student Award, Outstanding Academic Achievements Award and bursaries.
*   Education: The SAC provides assistance with student’s counselling and remedial programmes, enhances collaboration with overseas educational institutions and organises educational immersion programmes. To bring the school to a higher level, the SAC also strongly supports educational study trips for teachers and students.
